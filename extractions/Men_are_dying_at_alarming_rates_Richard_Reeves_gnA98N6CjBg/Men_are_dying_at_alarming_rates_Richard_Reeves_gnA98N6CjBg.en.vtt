00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.098
- One of the things I've noticed is that people are quite quick to blame

00:00:02.098 --> 00:00:03.558
if young men are struggling,

00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:04.642
if they're not in the labor market.

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:06.686
There's the eye roll and there's the,

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:08.938
"Well, if they could just get off the sofa

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:11.316
and stop smoking so much
weed and playing video games

00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:14.569
all day, maybe they'd make
something of themselves."

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.613
It's interesting that
that instinct to blame

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:19.824
is really not as common
for other groups (chuckles)

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.909
as it is for young men.

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.996
It is not that these young
men just lack responsibility.

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:25.913
They don't care anymore.

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:27.957
They're just feckless, to
use that great old word.

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:29.500
(slow, dramatic music)

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.754
There's this kind of general
sense of a lot of young men

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:36.549
feeling a bit caught in the
a pinball machine, almost.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:39.886
Like being told you're
too masculine on Tuesdays

00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:43.389
and that you're not masculine
enough on Wednesdays.

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:44.891
The best way I think to think about

00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:47.769
some of these men is lost.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.607
And so this sense of, "What's
my place in the world,

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:56.319
why am I needed, what's my role
going to be going forward?"

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.197
that's a very real question that many men

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:01.199
and boys are genuinely struggling with.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.492
It's made a lot of people realize

00:01:02.492 --> 00:01:06.496
there are a lot of young men
out there who are up for grabs,

00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:10.208
and that should send
some alarm bells ringing.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.294
I'm Richard Reeves.

00:01:13.294 --> 00:01:16.756
I'm president of the American
Institute for Boys and Men.

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:19.342
I'm also the author of
the book "Of Boys and Men:

00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:21.969
Why the Modern Male Is
Struggling, Why That Matters,

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.471
and What To Do About It."

00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:26.307
(screen clicking)

00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:33.022
It's certainly clear
that the issues of boys

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:35.400
and men haven't gone away
in the last few years.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.111
If anything, they're
getting even more attention,

00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:41.197
which is good when it's the
right kind of attention.

00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:42.699
That doesn't mean that it isn't still

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:44.742
a difficult conversation.

00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:47.662
I think that a conversation
about the challenges

00:01:47.662 --> 00:01:50.373
of boys and men should be difficult.

00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:51.916
And so when we get into questions

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:55.712
around differences in
learning style or risk taking,

00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:58.339
risk of addiction, competitiveness,

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:00.383
emotional vocabulary, et cetera,

00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:03.177
we shouldn't immediately
assume that we are stereotyping

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:05.346
every man and woman into that role.

00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:06.973
I get why people are worried about it

00:02:06.973 --> 00:02:09.517
because there are always
going to be people

00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:11.352
on the other end of the distribution,

00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:14.272
but it does mean that we
should respect and acknowledge

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:16.107
where there are these
differences on average

00:02:16.107 --> 00:02:17.316
between the two.
(pensive music)

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:19.110
As far as mental health is concerned,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.903
I'm really troubled by a
lot of the trends we see

00:02:20.903 --> 00:02:24.490
for both men and women, boys and girls.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.243
I think it's true to say
that a lot more attention

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:29.996
is being paid particularly
to the mental health

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:33.458
of teen girls and young
women than is often the case

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.710
for teen boys and young men.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.922
And so the mental health crisis
is playing out differently,

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:43.426
and that's very often I think
lost in the general debate.

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:46.679
One of the things that I've
discovered recently is the huge

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.391
rise in deaths from drug
poisoning among men,

00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:54.729
that has increased sixfold since 2001.

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.608
We've lost an additional 400,000 men.

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:02.111
That's the difference,
the increase is 400,000.

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.989
400,000 men is exactly the same number

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.574
that we lost in World War II.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.577
Drug poisoning deaths are up.

00:03:09.577 --> 00:03:11.537
It is already the case that men account

00:03:11.537 --> 00:03:12.997
for the majority of those deaths.

00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:16.167
So men account for 70%
of drug poisoning deaths.

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:20.004
They account for 80%
of suicides in the US.

00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:22.256
And one of the most troubling things

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:25.676
that we found in our
work is that, since 2010,

00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:28.930
the rise in suicide has
been almost entirely driven

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.556
among young men.

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:33.643
So among young men below
the age of about 30,

00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:37.480
the increase in suicides
has been almost a third.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.899
Whereas up until 2010, this was the period

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.443
of Great Recession,
huge economic problems,

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:44.612
we saw a really big
increase in the suicide rate

00:03:44.612 --> 00:03:46.113
among middle aged men.

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:48.991
But since 2010, something's happened.

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:53.996
The nature of the suicide
crisis among men has shifted

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:56.165
and we don't really know why.

00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.293
We see a lot of attention
going to the issues

00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:01.379
of teen girls in particular,

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.257
but less attention being
paid to the huge rise

00:04:04.257 --> 00:04:06.717
in suicide rates, for
example, among teen boys

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:08.010
and young men.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.137
We see a huge decline in the share

00:04:10.137 --> 00:04:13.015
of male therapists and counselors.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:16.978
Only one in five psychologists,
one in five social workers

00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:19.689
and lower numbers of counselors are men.

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.983
And all of those numbers
have more than halved

00:04:21.983 --> 00:04:24.402
just in the last few decades.

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:29.282
And that matters because for many men,

00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:32.243
boys, depending on the
nature of their issue,

00:04:32.243 --> 00:04:36.414
they may well find it easier
to talk to a male therapist.

00:04:36.414 --> 00:04:39.876
And it's already difficult to get many men

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:43.337
to come forward and get help
for mental health problems.

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:45.298
They are much less likely
to do so than women.

00:04:45.298 --> 00:04:48.092
(camera reel clicking)
(pensive music)

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:51.804
In 1971, men accounted for
slightly more than half,

00:04:51.804 --> 00:04:56.142
56% of people doing a
psychology undergraduate degree.

00:04:56.142 --> 00:05:00.313
Now it's 20% and falling.

00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:03.608
In the space of a really
short period of time,

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:05.693
we've taken an area like psychology,

00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:07.778
which used to be pretty gender balanced,

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:10.531
it was neither a male
nor a female profession,

00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.576
and now it's becoming a female profession.

00:05:13.576 --> 00:05:17.246
And I'm gonna risk saying that

00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:21.459
the psychology profession
cratering the share of men

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:24.962
is as big a problem as
the lack of women in,

00:05:24.962 --> 00:05:28.049
say, areas like tech or engineering,

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:29.216
where we're working very hard

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:31.052
and we have to make more progress.

00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:32.970
And maybe it's even more important,

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.806
maybe that some of these
professions like teaching,

00:05:35.806 --> 00:05:37.892
like mental health, maybe
those are professions

00:05:37.892 --> 00:05:40.478
where representation matters even more,

00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:42.480
representation of all kinds.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.193
And so the alarm bells
should be ringing very loudly

00:05:47.193 --> 00:05:50.446
when critical professions
like teaching, psychology

00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:54.992
and social work are becoming
gendered right in front of us.

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:57.161
And we're not doing anything about that.

00:05:57.161 --> 00:05:59.914
So we should be redoubling
our efforts to reach those men

00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:02.500
and make it easier for them
to come through the door,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.418
easier for them to put their hands up

00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:06.045
and say that they're struggling.

00:06:08.923 --> 00:06:10.800
One of the most important
things for anybody

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.135
is to be connected and have purpose,

00:06:13.135 --> 00:06:16.180
to be, you know, doing
something that they value

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.307
and other people value with their lives.

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:20.726
And what we've seen is a
decline in the share of men

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:22.561
in the labor force.

00:06:22.561 --> 00:06:25.940
The decline has been perhaps
most worrying among young men.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.193
Now you might say, "Well,
fewer men are in the workforce

00:06:29.193 --> 00:06:30.987
doing the kind of traditional male thing,

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:32.279
which has been the breadwinner."

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:36.158
But that's great because
they're now raising the kids

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:38.244
and maybe their partners or
their wives or girlfriends

00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:40.037
are in the labor force
and it's been a swap.

00:06:40.037 --> 00:06:43.165
(lighthearted music)
But that's not what we see.

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.876
We're not just talking
about non-employment.

00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:49.088
We're talking about a break
from society more generally.

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:51.257
And we see that in all
kinds of other areas too.

00:06:51.257 --> 00:06:53.467
So if you think about men
without a college degree,

00:06:53.467 --> 00:06:57.596
for example, their wages
are no higher today

00:06:57.596 --> 00:07:00.099
than they were in 1979.

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:05.062
That's almost half a century
of stagnant wages for most men.

00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:08.065
And men who are born into
lower income families

00:07:08.065 --> 00:07:10.568
are worse off on most measures than men

00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:13.738
who are born just 15 years
earlier into those families.

00:07:13.738 --> 00:07:15.197
For men at the top of the distribution,

00:07:15.197 --> 00:07:18.159
men who've got college degrees,
who are in the labor market,

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.243
you know, they're doing better.

00:07:19.243 --> 00:07:21.203
You continue to see their wages rising.

00:07:21.203 --> 00:07:22.997
And it doesn't mean that
there aren't still challenges

00:07:22.997 --> 00:07:27.334
for those men, but the sharp edge

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:28.878
of the issues facing boys and men

00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:30.755
is absolutely being felt by the men

00:07:30.755 --> 00:07:32.631
with the least economic power.

00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:34.050
And of course there's so much more to do

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.385
for women at the top of the distribution.

00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:37.928
Now, there aren't enough women CEOs,

00:07:37.928 --> 00:07:39.305
there aren't enough women politicians.

00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:41.766
We still don't have enough
female representation

00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:44.268
in those senior positions
that you can very often

00:07:44.268 --> 00:07:47.104
just be looking up and
seeing the lack of women.

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:50.524
But if you just pause for
a moment and look down,

00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:52.401
look at those who are in less fortunate

00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:54.570
economic circumstances than you,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.530
that's when you really see the struggles

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.032
of men becoming most acute.

00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:03.537
There are tens of millions
of working class men

00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:07.500
and women struggling to figure
out this new labor market,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.211
this new economy, and the
changes in the economy

00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:14.882
have been particularly
brutal for working class men.

00:08:14.882 --> 00:08:17.218
And so it's really important
to be able to hold both

00:08:17.218 --> 00:08:19.428
of these thoughts in our
head, which is that of course

00:08:19.428 --> 00:08:21.889
it matters that we need
to do more for women,

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:24.100
close the gender pay gap,
more representation of women

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.684
in those senior positions.

00:08:26.644 --> 00:08:29.855
But I think it's a general
point that it's been a problem

00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:32.525
for too many people that they focused

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:36.654
almost exclusively on the kind
of elite part of the problem,

00:08:36.654 --> 00:08:39.281
the apex of our society.

00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:40.699
And that has meant that there has been

00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:43.661
a really dangerous neglect
of many of the problems

00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:47.957
of people who are not worrying
about who's gonna be CEO.

00:08:47.957 --> 00:08:50.292
They're worried about
who's gonna bring home

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:52.878
enough money to feed the kids this week.

00:08:52.878 --> 00:08:53.796
- In this video, I'm gonna show you

00:08:53.796 --> 00:08:55.714
how to get rich extremely quickly.

00:08:55.714 --> 00:08:57.550
Now people say it's
impossible to get rich quick.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.425
Well I did.

00:08:58.425 --> 00:09:00.636
- Now I made my first million
dollars at 18 years old.

00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:01.887
- I developed a blueprint.

00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:04.181
- If you're a teenager in 2023,

00:09:04.181 --> 00:09:05.099
becoming a millionaire is simple.

00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:06.809
- There's something
else going on here too,

00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:08.477
which is the get-rich-quick thing.

00:09:08.477 --> 00:09:11.147
Online, there's a bit of
a culture around like men

00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:13.399
need to get wealthy, they
need to do it quickly.

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:15.818
They don't wanna work for like corporates.

00:09:15.818 --> 00:09:17.778
They don't wanna climb
their upper labor market.

00:09:17.778 --> 00:09:19.405
They don't wanna start
in an entry-level job

00:09:19.405 --> 00:09:21.907
and work their way up,
not when there are these

00:09:21.907 --> 00:09:24.869
sort of very shiny objects online,

00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:26.954
especially that could
make you rich quickly.

00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:28.747
And of course there are examples online

00:09:28.747 --> 00:09:30.916
of men who've done that
and who've managed to get

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:32.418
a lot of wealth very quickly.

00:09:32.418 --> 00:09:34.420
They are the exception
that proves the rule.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.130
- When you're in the stage
where you're still obsessed

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.215
over getting rich, it
should be the only thing

00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:39.633
that you think about and the only thing

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:41.260
that you put your energy towards.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.511
- And I worry a lot actually

00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:44.555
that we have overdone the importance

00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:46.932
of entrepreneurship in recent debates.

00:09:46.932 --> 00:09:49.560
We've got entrepreneurship,
we need more entrepreneurs.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.937
And that's how you get out of
poverty if you're a young man.

00:09:51.937 --> 00:09:53.939
And that is almost certainly not true.

00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:55.858
(gentle music)
And those algorithms

00:09:55.858 --> 00:09:58.319
and those online platforms
are just very good at playing

00:09:58.319 --> 00:10:02.072
into that higher risk appetite

00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:03.908
among young men especially.

00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:06.577
And it is a little bit like a fish hook.

00:10:06.577 --> 00:10:08.996
It's a shiny object kind
of in the water and you go,

00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:10.956
"Oh, oh, and that's gonna make me wealthy,

00:10:10.956 --> 00:10:11.790
that's gonna solve my problem."

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.210
And you grab it and then,
and then you are hooked.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.631
In states where you see sports
betting online going legal,

00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:22.843
an increase in bankruptcies,
reduction in credit score

00:10:22.843 --> 00:10:27.306
and general economic difficulties,
especially for young men

00:10:27.306 --> 00:10:30.267
and especially for the
lower income young men.

00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:33.812
Men are much more likely
to become addicted

00:10:33.812 --> 00:10:35.147
to most things actually,

00:10:35.147 --> 00:10:38.525
but especially to things
like online gambling.

00:10:38.525 --> 00:10:40.361
And there are all kinds
of reasons for that

00:10:40.361 --> 00:10:42.780
about the dopamine system,
especially among young men,

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.033
et cetera and this kind of high
that you get from the reward

00:10:46.033 --> 00:10:48.035
of kind of a bet paying off, et cetera.

00:10:48.035 --> 00:10:50.246
There's a reason why this
is predominantly a problem

00:10:50.246 --> 00:10:52.539
among men, which is
men are more vulnerable

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:54.792
to that particular kind of risk,

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:57.127
that particular kind of addiction.

00:11:00.756 --> 00:11:04.510
If we're not careful, these
conversations can shut

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.845
the conversation down
with boys and young men

00:11:06.845 --> 00:11:08.264
rather than opening it up.

00:11:08.264 --> 00:11:11.809
Sometimes parents sort
of react to discovering

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:15.271
that their son, for example,
is consuming video content

00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:16.897
from somebody like Andrew Tate,

00:11:16.897 --> 00:11:19.066
pretty well known misogynist influencer.

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:20.943
It's almost like they're
watching hardcore porn.

00:11:20.943 --> 00:11:23.404
You know, they're sort
of, they slam the laptop

00:11:23.404 --> 00:11:25.072
with the same kind of moral fervor,

00:11:25.072 --> 00:11:26.657
and that's the wrong response.

00:11:26.657 --> 00:11:28.367
It's a natural response,
it's the wrong response.

00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:29.785
Instead, you've gotta have curiosity.

00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:30.619
You've gotta figure out like,

00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:31.787
"Well, why are you interested in this?"

00:11:31.787 --> 00:11:33.706
Let's have the argument.

00:11:33.706 --> 00:11:34.957
Because one of the things

00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:38.544
that the most successful
reactionary online figures say

00:11:38.544 --> 00:11:43.173
is nobody will want you to
talk about watching my stuff

00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:44.300
or listening to my stuff.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.135
If you even mention to somebody

00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:49.138
that you are interested in
this, watch how they react.

00:11:49.138 --> 00:11:50.222
You've just proved the point

00:11:50.222 --> 00:11:52.474
that the reactionary was making.

00:11:52.474 --> 00:11:55.686
And this is one of those
moments where it's hard,

00:11:55.686 --> 00:11:59.189
but I'm speaking here as a
parent as much as a policy wonk,

00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:01.775
is that you take some deep breaths,

00:12:01.775 --> 00:12:06.238
you try to be open-minded,
and you try to become

00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:09.158
an ally and a partner to your son

00:12:09.158 --> 00:12:12.161
as they navigate this
difficult online world

00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:13.620
and offline world.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.415
So what does non-toxic
masculinity look like?

00:12:16.415 --> 00:12:19.626
Being not toxic is not a
hugely aspirational goal

00:12:19.626 --> 00:12:21.003
for many of us.

00:12:21.003 --> 00:12:23.297
Like I didn't raise my sons and say,

00:12:23.297 --> 00:12:27.217
"Just think boys one day,
you might not be poisonous."

00:12:27.217 --> 00:12:31.680
I honestly believe that the
way to beat the online world

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.600
is offline, is in real life,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.227
by having male teachers,
male coaches, fathers,

00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:38.729
uncles, neighbors, et cetera,

00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:40.939
just being a living and breathing version

00:12:40.939 --> 00:12:42.983
of what it means to be a man.

00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:45.486
I continue to believe
that in the long run,

00:12:45.486 --> 00:12:48.864
boys, young men will believe their eyes

00:12:48.864 --> 00:12:50.115
more than their ears.

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:54.661
And so if there isn't enough of a sense of

00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:56.747
what does it mean to be
a man in my community,

00:12:56.747 --> 00:12:59.917
in my home, in my school, et cetera,

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:02.336
if there's a lack of real life men

00:13:03.212 --> 00:13:05.047
showing what it means to be a man

00:13:05.047 --> 00:13:07.383
rather than telling you how to be a man,

00:13:07.383 --> 00:13:09.343
then I think that creates a vacuum

00:13:09.343 --> 00:13:11.678
which then gets filled by online figures.

00:13:13.305 --> 00:13:15.766
Well, what should we do about it?

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:18.143
You're starting to see
people wanting to govern

00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:21.814
around this issue, wanting to
make policy around this issue.

00:13:21.814 --> 00:13:25.109
And some of the things they're
looking at are things like

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:26.360
increasing the share of men

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.196
in their mental health workforce,

00:13:29.196 --> 00:13:31.240
having more targeted outreach programs

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.326
to do suicide prevention,
very specifically targeted,

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:37.121
are men who are at four times
of risk of losing their life

00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:38.914
to suicide, especially young men,

00:13:38.914 --> 00:13:41.417
and a big push around
getting more male teachers

00:13:41.417 --> 00:13:43.001
into our classrooms.

00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:46.755
There is something very
important about boys and girls

00:13:46.755 --> 00:13:48.841
seeing education as something that both

00:13:48.841 --> 00:13:51.427
men and women value and do.

00:13:51.427 --> 00:13:53.554
Men actually make up
the minority of teachers

00:13:53.554 --> 00:13:56.140
in basically every subject now,

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.851
including career and technical education.

00:13:58.851 --> 00:14:01.270
It was 33% in the early 80s.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.356
It's now 23% and falling.
(pensive music)

00:14:04.356 --> 00:14:07.234
There are many fewer men in teaching now

00:14:07.234 --> 00:14:09.653
than there are women in
the stem professions.

00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:12.698
Also, I think that the
presence of men in schools

00:14:12.698 --> 00:14:15.993
and in classrooms acts as a way

00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:19.705
to have some actual role models
that are good alternative

00:14:19.705 --> 00:14:22.082
to the ones online perhaps,
especially for boys

00:14:22.082 --> 00:14:24.626
who don't have a father
figure in their lives

00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:27.129
or a good relationship with their fathers.

00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:29.381
One of the wonderful
things about male teachers

00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:30.549
is that they're also coaches.

00:14:30.549 --> 00:14:32.676
So about a third of the men

00:14:32.676 --> 00:14:35.304
who are teaching K-12 are also coaching.

00:14:35.304 --> 00:14:37.931
So the school bell
rings, they keep working,

00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:39.641
they keep doing coaching,

00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.311
and that's a great
additional benefit we get

00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:44.438
from getting those men into teaching.

00:14:44.438 --> 00:14:46.815
I also think that coaches

00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:51.445
are mental health
professionals in disguise.

00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:54.072
They're sitting shoulder to shoulder

00:14:54.072 --> 00:14:56.408
on a bench or in a group,

00:14:56.408 --> 00:14:59.453
they're working with
boys or with young men.

00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:03.040
And they're very often noticing
that they're struggling,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.626
and they can, in a very, very safe way,

00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:06.793
in a non-threatening way,

00:15:06.793 --> 00:15:09.046
they can open up a conversation with them.

00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:10.506
And there's a reason I think

00:15:10.506 --> 00:15:15.511
why so many men will say that a coach

00:15:16.053 --> 00:15:18.347
played an hugely important
part in their role,

00:15:18.347 --> 00:15:19.348
especially if they didn't have

00:15:19.348 --> 00:15:20.974
a strong relationship with their father.

00:15:20.974 --> 00:15:22.851
It's a trope at this point to say

00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:25.145
that coaches are father figures,

00:15:25.145 --> 00:15:26.813
but it's also a truth,

00:15:26.813 --> 00:15:29.441
that for many boys they
absolutely do play that role.

00:15:30.442 --> 00:15:33.362
One of the things we know is that men

00:15:33.362 --> 00:15:36.323
communicate more
comfortably with each other

00:15:36.323 --> 00:15:39.451
shoulder to shoulder as
opposed to face to face.

00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:41.119
When men are face to face with each other,

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:43.038
that's quite a threatening position.

00:15:43.038 --> 00:15:45.249
Now, if I tell you this, you
won't be able to unsee it.

00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:46.625
Where every time you go to a social event,

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:49.044
if you want to communicate with young men,

00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:52.214
go fishing, go for a drive, go for a hike.

00:15:52.214 --> 00:15:53.257
A lot of psychologists now

00:15:53.257 --> 00:15:55.175
will do the walk and talk therapy.

00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:57.844
And so there's something
also about those activities,

00:15:57.844 --> 00:15:59.471
whatever the activity is,

00:15:59.471 --> 00:16:01.306
you're doing something
together shoulder to shoulder,

00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:04.017
what you're actually doing
then is communicating.

00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:05.852
I have a friend that
volunteers in a school,

00:16:05.852 --> 00:16:07.813
and he goes into the school,

00:16:07.813 --> 00:16:09.273
and he says, "Which boy are you having

00:16:09.273 --> 00:16:10.691
the most trouble with?"

00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:13.944
They identify the boy and he
just takes him for a walk.

00:16:13.944 --> 00:16:15.571
He doesn't sit down with him,

00:16:15.571 --> 00:16:17.614
he doesn't pull up a
chair in the classroom.

00:16:17.614 --> 00:16:20.075
He certainly doesn't sit opposite him.

00:16:20.075 --> 00:16:23.161
He finds that they're much
more likely to open up,

00:16:23.161 --> 00:16:26.039
say, "Oh, let's just take
a walk and then talk."

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:27.207
You could roll your eyes at that

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:29.293
and just say, "Oh, what's wrong with men?"

00:16:29.293 --> 00:16:33.130
But we have to be really careful
generally not to treat men

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.216
like defective women, or vice versa.

00:16:36.216 --> 00:16:37.926
It's just that there are
some of these differences

00:16:37.926 --> 00:16:40.679
between us that we
don't really think about

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:42.347
until it becomes an issue,

00:16:42.347 --> 00:16:44.933
and which should just be part
of just a natural difference

00:16:44.933 --> 00:16:47.436
between us that doesn't
in any way trap anybody.

00:16:48.979 --> 00:16:52.107
I've asked a lot of men and boys,

00:16:52.107 --> 00:16:54.651
"What do you like about
being a boy or a man?"

00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:56.320
And it's really interesting how hard

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.114
it is to get people to
answer that question.

00:16:59.114 --> 00:17:02.909
What's happened is that a
straightforward acknowledgement

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:06.747
of the ways in which men can be good

00:17:07.873 --> 00:17:11.668
runs the risk of somehow
being seen as a claim

00:17:11.668 --> 00:17:13.962
that they are therefore better than women.

00:17:13.962 --> 00:17:16.048
But let's be specific.

00:17:16.048 --> 00:17:19.760
It is true that men take more risks

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.845
than women on average.

00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:26.683
Distributions overlap, but men
have a higher risk appetite.

00:17:26.683 --> 00:17:28.810
Is that a good or a bad thing about men?

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.479
And the answer is yes,

00:17:30.479 --> 00:17:33.523
it is a good and a bad thing about men.

00:17:33.523 --> 00:17:36.902
It is good when it leads men to take risks

00:17:36.902 --> 00:17:38.945
to save the lives of others.

00:17:38.945 --> 00:17:41.406
It is bad if it means that they blow

00:17:41.406 --> 00:17:42.949
all their money gambling,

00:17:42.949 --> 00:17:45.202
or they take crazy risks
and end up drowning

00:17:45.202 --> 00:17:49.247
or dying or ending up taking
drugs in a certain way.

00:17:49.247 --> 00:17:53.460
And so is it better to have a more

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.672
stereotypically female
approach to risk or male?

00:17:56.672 --> 00:17:59.007
And the answer is neither. We need both.

00:17:59.007 --> 00:18:03.303
We need a society that actually
recognizes and honors both.

00:18:03.303 --> 00:18:05.305
I have this very vivid memory of walking

00:18:05.305 --> 00:18:07.391
with one of my sons into schools,

00:18:07.391 --> 00:18:09.935
and we're walking down
this kinda long hallway,

00:18:09.935 --> 00:18:12.270
and one side of the hallway is the place

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.522
where they had all the notice boards

00:18:13.522 --> 00:18:15.941
for the things they were doing
for the girls in the school.

00:18:15.941 --> 00:18:19.861
So there were girls on
the run, girls who code,

00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:22.781
there was a women's
scholarship night coming up.

00:18:22.781 --> 00:18:23.740
(pensive music)

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.120
And the opposite wall was, as
it happened, completely empty.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.496
And it just had this real moment

00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:31.998
of trying to see this through his eyes

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:36.962
and realizing that there is
an implicit message here,

00:18:36.962 --> 00:18:39.548
which is we need to do
all this stuff for girls.

00:18:39.548 --> 00:18:43.635
"The future is female," was
one of the signs on that wall.

00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:45.303
And we don't need to do anything for boys

00:18:45.303 --> 00:18:48.140
because the world is made for boys.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.808
Men are gonna be fine.

00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:51.727
And I really think that's out of date.

00:18:51.727 --> 00:18:53.687
We've created a culture in our schools

00:18:53.687 --> 00:18:58.358
where we are so concerned
rightly in many ways

00:18:58.358 --> 00:19:00.277
about the prospects of women and girls

00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:03.029
that we haven't allowed the
data to catch up with that

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:04.489
and say, "Yeah, but boys are now

00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:06.241
way behind girls in school."

00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:08.493
If you take something like GPA,

00:19:08.493 --> 00:19:09.870
which is a pretty good measure

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.789
of overall high school achievement,
if you take the top 10%

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:16.209
of students, two thirds of them are girls.

00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:18.211
And if you take the
bottom 10% of students,

00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:19.921
two thirds of them are boys.

00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:22.591
Pretty straight line
relationship between them.

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:25.385
In the average school district in the US,

00:19:25.385 --> 00:19:28.263
the girls are almost a grade
level ahead in English.

00:19:28.263 --> 00:19:30.140
There's no gap in math.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.516
In the poorest school districts,

00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:34.269
the boys are behind in
both English and math.

00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:37.564
And so we just have to be
careful not to inadvertently

00:19:37.564 --> 00:19:39.274
send the message to boys
that they're kind of

00:19:39.274 --> 00:19:41.318
just not as seen or they're not as heard

00:19:41.318 --> 00:19:43.445
or they're not as valued
in the school setting.

00:19:43.445 --> 00:19:46.990
How do we maintain this
really wonderful idea

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.410
of the empowering and uplifting atmosphere

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.079
that I think we've had around
women and girls in schools,

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:56.708
but do the same for boys and
try and create this sense of it

00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:58.627
being uplifting for both.

00:19:58.627 --> 00:20:01.463
I didn't think about this at
all when I was younger myself.

00:20:01.463 --> 00:20:03.340
Like, "The future is female"
is probably something

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.341
I would've gone along with,

00:20:04.341 --> 00:20:07.177
like as a good male feminist or whatever.

00:20:07.177 --> 00:20:09.888
But actually that's a terrible phrase.

00:20:09.888 --> 00:20:11.640
Like, the future can't be female or male.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.100
It has to be for everybody.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.686
We have got to update the
way we talk about this.

00:20:16.686 --> 00:20:19.189
We have got to update the
way we think about this

00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:22.818
and to do so in a way that
in no way puts the brakes on

00:20:23.944 --> 00:20:27.113
girls and women, but which
doesn't inadvertently,

00:20:27.113 --> 00:20:29.157
in our efforts to promote women and girls,

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:30.867
send this message to boys and men

00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:32.452
either that they don't matter as much

00:20:32.452 --> 00:20:34.371
or that they don't need as much.

00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:36.206
And neither of those things are true.
