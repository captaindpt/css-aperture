# Content Analysis: Men Are Dying at Alarming Rates - Richard Reeves

## Overview

Richard Reeves, president of the American Institute for Boys and Men and author of "Of Boys and Men," presents a data-driven analysis of the crisis facing men and boys in modern America. He argues that while attention focuses on women at the top of the economic distribution, **the sharp edge of gender inequality now cuts hardest against working-class men and boys**. The crisis manifests in alarming mortality statistics, educational collapse, economic stagnation, and social disconnection.

## Key Findings

### Theme 1: The Death Crisis - Men Dying at Alarming Rates

**Drug Poisoning Deaths: A Silent Epidemic**

> "One of the things that I've discovered recently is the huge rise in deaths from drug poisoning among men, that has increased **sixfold since 2001**. We've lost an additional **400,000 men**. That's the difference, the increase is 400,000. **400,000 men is exactly the same number that we lost in World War II**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 7, Score: 0.259)

**Men's Share of Deaths**:
> "Men account for **70% of drug poisoning deaths**. They account for **80% of suicides in the US**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 9, Score: 0.581)

**The Shift in Suicide Crisis**

> "One of the most troubling things that we found in our work is that, since 2010, the rise in suicide has been **almost entirely driven among young men**. So among young men below the age of about 30, the increase in suicides has been **almost a third**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 10, Score: 0.556)

**Pre-2010 vs Post-2010**:
- **Before 2010** (Great Recession): Suicide spike among **middle-aged men** (economic crisis)
- **After 2010**: Suicide spike among **young men under 30** (cause unknown)

> "The nature of the suicide crisis among men has shifted and we don't really know why. We see a lot of attention going to the issues of teen girls in particular, but **less attention being paid to the huge rise in suicide rates**, for example, among teen boys and young men."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 11-12, Score: 0.453, 0.431)

### Theme 2: The Mental Health Workforce Crisis

**Collapse of Male Representation**

> "We see a huge decline in the share of male therapists and counselors. Only **one in five psychologists, one in five social workers** and lower numbers of counselors are men. And all of those numbers have **more than halved** just in the last few decades."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 13)

**Psychology's Gender Flip**:
- **1971**: Men were 56% of psychology undergraduates
- **Now**: Men are **20% and falling**

> "In the space of a really short period of time, we've taken an area like psychology, which used to be pretty gender balanced, it was neither a male nor a female profession, **and now it's becoming a female profession**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 15)

**Why This Matters**:

> "And that matters because for many men, boys, depending on the nature of their issue, they may well find it easier to talk to a male therapist. And it's already difficult to get many men to come forward and get help for mental health problems. **They are much less likely to do so than women**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 13-14, Score: 0.214, 0.162)

**Bold Claim**:

> "And I'm gonna risk saying that the psychology profession **cratering the share of men is as big a problem as the lack of women in, say, areas like tech or engineering**, where we're working very hard and we have to make more progress. And maybe it's even more important, maybe that some of these professions like teaching, like mental health, maybe those are professions where **representation matters even more**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 15, Score: 0.521)

### Theme 3: Educational Collapse - Boys Falling Behind

**The Achievement Gap**

> "We've created a culture in our schools where we are so concerned rightly in many ways about the prospects of women and girls that we haven't allowed the data to catch up with that and say, 'Yeah, but **boys are now way behind girls in school**.'"
> - Reeves (Result ID: 56, Score: 0.552)

**Stark Statistics**:

**Top 10% of students**: Two-thirds are **girls**
**Bottom 10% of students**: Two-thirds are **boys**

> "Pretty straight line relationship between them. In the average school district in the US, **the girls are almost a grade level ahead in English**. There's no gap in math. In the poorest school districts, **the boys are behind in both English and math**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 57-58, Score: 0.578, 0.439)

**The Message Boys Receive**:

> "And so we just have to be careful not to inadvertently send the message to boys that they're kind of **just not as seen or they're not as heard or they're not as valued in the school setting**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 58, Score: 0.439)

### Theme 4: The Disappearance of Male Teachers

**Dramatic Decline**

> "Men actually make up the minority of teachers in basically every subject now, including career and technical education. It was **33% in the early 80s**. It's now **23% and falling**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 40, Score: 0.526)

**Comparison**:
> "There are **many fewer men in teaching now than there are women in the STEM professions**."
> - Reeves

**Why Male Teachers Matter**:

> "There is something very important about boys and girls seeing education as something that **both men and women value and do**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 39, Score: 0.580)

**Male Teachers as Coaches**:

> "One of the wonderful things about male teachers is that **they're also coaches**. So about **a third of the men who are teaching K-12 are also coaching**. So the school bell rings, they keep working, they keep doing coaching, and that's a great additional benefit we get from getting those men into teaching."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 41, Score: 0.345)

**Coaches as Mental Health Professionals**:

> "I also think that **coaches are mental health professionals in disguise**. They're sitting shoulder to shoulder on a bench or in a group, they're working with boys or with young men. And they're very often noticing that they're struggling, and they can, in a very, very safe way, in a non-threatening way, they can open up a conversation with them."
> - Reeves

**Coaches as Father Figures**:

> "And there's a reason I think why so many men will say that a coach played an hugely important part in their role, especially if they didn't have a strong relationship with their father. **It's a trope at this point to say that coaches are father figures, but it's also a truth**, that for many boys they absolutely do play that role."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 43-44, Score: 0.259, 0.244)

### Theme 5: Economic Stagnation for Working-Class Men

**Half a Century of No Progress**

> "So if you think about men without a college degree, for example, their wages are **no higher today than they were in 1979**. That's **almost half a century of stagnant wages for most men**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 20, Score: 0.294)

**Generational Decline**:

> "And men who are born into lower income families are **worse off on most measures than men who are born just 15 years earlier** into those families."
> - Reeves

**The Class Divide**:

> "For men at the top of the distribution, men who've got college degrees, who are in the labor market, you know, they're doing better. You continue to see their wages rising. And it doesn't mean that there aren't still challenges for those men, but the **sharp edge of the issues facing boys and men is absolutely being felt by the men with the least economic power**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 21, Score: 0.503)

**Labor Force Withdrawal**:

> "And what we've seen is a decline in the share of men in the labor force. **The decline has been perhaps most worrying among young men**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 17, Score: 0.452)

**Not a Gender Swap**:

> "Now you might say, 'Well, fewer men are in the workforce doing the kind of traditional male thing, which has been the breadwinner. But that's great because they're now raising the kids and maybe their partners or their wives or girlfriends are in the labor force and it's been a swap.' But **that's not what we see**. We're not just talking about non-employment. **We're talking about a break from society more generally**."
> - Reeves

### Theme 6: Looking Up vs Looking Down

**The Selective Focus Problem**

> "And of course there's so much more to do for women at the top of the distribution. Now, there aren't enough women CEOs, there aren't enough women politicians. We still don't have enough female representation in those senior positions that you can very often just be looking up and seeing the lack of women. But **if you just pause for a moment and look down**, look at those who are in less fortunate economic circumstances than you, **that's when you really see the struggles of men becoming most acute**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 22)

**The Dangerous Focus on Elites**:

> "But I think it's a general point that it's been a problem for too many people that they focused almost exclusively on the kind of elite part of the problem, the apex of our society. And that has meant that there has been a **really dangerous neglect of many of the problems of people who are not worrying about who's gonna be CEO**. They're worried about **who's gonna bring home enough money to feed the kids this week**."
> - Reeves

### Theme 7: The Get-Rich-Quick Trap

**Online Culture of Instant Wealth**

> "There's something else going on here too, which is the get-rich-quick thing. Online, there's a bit of a culture around like **men need to get wealthy, they need to do it quickly**. They don't wanna work for like corporates. They don't wanna climb their upper labor market. They don't wanna start in an entry-level job and work their way up, not when there are these sort of **very shiny objects online**, especially that could make you rich quickly."
> - Reeves

**The Exception That Proves the Rule**:

> "And of course there are examples online of men who've done that and who've managed to get a lot of wealth very quickly. **They are the exception that proves the rule**."
> - Reeves

**The Entrepreneurship Myth**:

> "And I worry a lot actually that we have **overdone the importance of entrepreneurship** in recent debates. We've got entrepreneurship, we need more entrepreneurs. And that's how you get out of poverty if you're a young man. **And that is almost certainly not true**."
> - Reeves

**Algorithms as Fish Hooks**:

> "And those algorithms and those online platforms are just very good at **playing into that higher risk appetite among young men** especially. And it is a little bit like a **fish hook**. It's a shiny object kind of in the water and you go, 'Oh, oh, and that's gonna make me wealthy, that's gonna solve my problem.' And you grab it and then, and then **you are hooked**."
> - Reeves

### Theme 8: Online Gambling Crisis

**The Perfect Storm for Young Men**

> "In states where you see sports betting online going legal, **an increase in bankruptcies, reduction in credit score and general economic difficulties**, especially for young men and especially for the lower income young men. **Men are much more likely to become addicted to most things actually**, but especially to things like online gambling."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 32, Score: 0.148)

**Why Men Are Vulnerable**:

> "And there are all kinds of reasons for that about the dopamine system, especially among young men, et cetera and this kind of high that you get from the reward of kind of a bet paying off, et cetera. There's a reason why this is **predominantly a problem among men**, which is **men are more vulnerable to that particular kind of risk**, that particular kind of addiction."
> - Reeves

### Theme 9: The Andrew Tate Problem - How to Respond

**The Wrong Response**:

> "Sometimes parents sort of react to discovering that their son, for example, is consuming video content from somebody like Andrew Tate, pretty well known misogynist influencer. It's almost like they're watching hardcore porn. You know, they're sort of, **they slam the laptop with the same kind of moral fervor, and that's the wrong response**. It's a natural response, it's the wrong response."
> - Reeves

**The Right Response - Curiosity**:

> "Instead, you've gotta have **curiosity**. You've gotta figure out like, 'Well, why are you interested in this?' **Let's have the argument**."
> - Reeves

**The Reactionary's Playbook**:

> "Because one of the things that the most successful reactionary online figures say is **nobody will want you to talk about watching my stuff or listening to my stuff. If you even mention to somebody that you are interested in this, watch how they react. You've just proved the point that the reactionary was making**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 36, Score: 0.133)

**Parental Strategy**:

> "And this is one of those moments where it's hard, but I'm speaking here as a parent as much as a policy wonk, is that **you take some deep breaths, you try to be open-minded, and you try to become an ally and a partner to your son** as they navigate this difficult online world and offline world."
> - Reeves

### Theme 10: Lost and Confused - The Modern Male Predicament

**Caught in a Pinball Machine**:

> "There's this kind of general sense of a lot of young men feeling a bit caught in the a **pinball machine, almost**. Like being told **you're too masculine on Tuesdays and that you're not masculine enough on Wednesdays**. The best way I think to think about some of these men is **lost**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 2, Score: 0.528)

**The Existential Question**:

> "And so this sense of, '**What's my place in the world, why am I needed, what's my role going to be going forward?**' that's a very real question that many men and boys are genuinely struggling with."
> - Reeves

**Up for Grabs**:

> "It's made a lot of people realize there are **a lot of young men out there who are up for grabs**, and that should send some alarm bells ringing."
> - Reeves

### Theme 11: The Instinct to Blame

**Double Standard**:

> "One of the things I've noticed is that **people are quite quick to blame if young men are struggling**, if they're not in the labor market. There's the eye roll and there's the, 'Well, if they could just get off the sofa and stop smoking so much weed and playing video games all day, maybe they'd make something of themselves.' It's interesting that that **instinct to blame is really not as common for other groups** (chuckles) as it is for young men."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 0, Score: 0.184)

**Not Feckless**:

> "It is not that these young men just lack responsibility. They don't care anymore. They're just **feckless**, to use that great old word."
> - Reeves

### Theme 12: The "Future is Female" Problem

**The Hallway Moment**:

> "I have this very vivid memory of walking with one of my sons into schools, and we're walking down this kinda long hallway, and one side of the hallway is the place where they had all the notice boards for the things they were doing for the girls in the school. So there were **girls on the run, girls who code, there was a women's scholarship night coming up**. (pensive music) And **the opposite wall was, as it happened, completely empty**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 54, Score: 0.485)

**The Implicit Message**:

> "And it just had this real moment of trying to see this through his eyes and realizing that there is an **implicit message here**, which is we need to do all this stuff for girls. **'The future is female,'** was one of the signs on that wall. And we don't need to do anything for boys because **the world is made for boys. Men are gonna be fine**. And I really think that's **out of date**."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 55, Score: 0.485)

**Rethinking the Phrase**:

> "I didn't think about this at all when I was younger myself. Like, 'The future is female' is probably something I would've gone along with, like as a good male feminist or whatever. **But actually that's a terrible phrase. Like, the future can't be female or male. It has to be for everybody**."
> - Reeves

**The Update Needed**:

> "We have got to update the way we talk about this. We have got to update the way we think about this and to do so in a way that **in no way puts the brakes on girls and women**, but which doesn't inadvertently, in our efforts to promote women and girls, **send this message to boys and men either that they don't matter as much or that they don't need as much**. And neither of those things are true."
> - Reeves

### Theme 13: Offline Solutions to Online Problems

**Real Life Beats Algorithms**:

> "I honestly believe that the **way to beat the online world is offline, is in real life**, by having **male teachers, male coaches, fathers, uncles, neighbors**, et cetera, just being a living and breathing version of what it means to be a man."
> - Reeves

**Showing vs Telling**:

> "I continue to believe that in the long run, **boys, young men will believe their eyes more than their ears**. And so if there isn't enough of a sense of what does it mean to be a man in my community, in my home, in my school, et cetera, **if there's a lack of real life men showing what it means to be a man rather than telling you how to be a man**, then I think that **creates a vacuum which then gets filled by online figures**."
> - Reeves

### Theme 14: Non-Toxic is Not Aspirational

**Beyond "Not Poisonous"**:

> "So what does non-toxic masculinity look like? **Being not toxic is not a hugely aspirational goal** for many of us. Like I didn't raise my sons and say, 'Just think boys one day, **you might not be poisonous**.'"
> - Reeves

### Theme 15: Understanding Male Communication

**Shoulder to Shoulder vs Face to Face**:

> "One of the things we know is that **men communicate more comfortably with each other shoulder to shoulder as opposed to face to face**. When men are face to face with each other, that's quite a threatening position."
> - Reeves

**The Walk and Talk**:

> "Now, if I tell you this, you won't be able to unsee it. Where every time you go to a social event, if you want to communicate with young men, **go fishing, go for a drive, go for a hike**. A lot of psychologists now will do the **walk and talk therapy**."
> - Reeves

**School Example**:

> "I have a friend that volunteers in a school, and he goes into the school, and he says, 'Which boy are you having the most trouble with?' They identify the boy and he **just takes him for a walk**. He doesn't sit down with him, he doesn't pull up a chair in the classroom. He certainly doesn't sit opposite him. He finds that they're **much more likely to open up**, say, 'Oh, let's just take a walk and then talk.'"
> - Reeves

**Not Defective Women**:

> "You could roll your eyes at that and just say, 'Oh, what's wrong with men?' But we have to be really careful generally **not to treat men like defective women**, or vice versa. It's just that there are some of these differences between us that we don't really think about until it becomes an issue."
> - Reeves

### Theme 16: Risk as Both Good and Bad

**The Question No One Can Answer**:

> "I've asked a lot of men and boys, '**What do you like about being a boy or a man?**' And it's really interesting **how hard it is to get people to answer that question**. What's happened is that a straightforward acknowledgement of the ways in which men can be good runs the risk of somehow being seen as a claim that they are therefore better than women."
> - Reeves

**Risk Taking - Both/And**:

> "But let's be specific. It is true that **men take more risks than women on average**. Distributions overlap, but men have a higher risk appetite. **Is that a good or a bad thing about men? And the answer is yes**, it is a good and a bad thing about men. It is **good when it leads men to take risks to save the lives of others**. It is **bad if it means that they blow all their money gambling**, or they take crazy risks and end up drowning or dying or ending up taking drugs in a certain way."
> - Reeves (Result ID: 51-52, Score: 0.127)

**We Need Both**:

> "And so is it better to have a more stereotypically female approach to risk or male? **And the answer is neither. We need both. We need a society that actually recognizes and honors both**."
> - Reeves

## Policy Proposals

### Immediate Actions

1. **Increase male mental health professionals**
   - Targeted recruitment for psychology programs
   - Scholarships for men entering counseling/social work

2. **Targeted suicide prevention**
   - Programs specifically for young men under 30
   - Recognition that men are at 4x risk

3. **More male teachers in classrooms**
   - Currently 23% and falling (was 33% in early 80s)
   - Fewer men in teaching than women in STEM
   - Special value of male teachers who also coach

4. **Acknowledge the education gap**
   - Boys are a grade level behind in English
   - Top 10% students: 2/3 girls
   - Bottom 10% students: 2/3 boys

5. **Update school culture**
   - Balance "girls who code" with programs for boys
   - Move beyond "the future is female"
   - Create uplifting atmosphere for both

## Conclusions

### Main Arguments

1. **Men are dying at alarming rates**: 400,000 additional drug poisoning deaths since 2001 (equal to WWII losses); 80% of suicides; young male suicide up 33% since 2010

2. **The mental health workforce crisis exacerbates the problem**: Male therapists/psychologists down from 56% to 20%; men less likely to seek help and now less likely to find male therapists

3. **Educational collapse**: Boys a grade level behind in English; 2/3 of top students are girls; 2/3 of bottom students are boys

4. **Economic stagnation for working-class men**: Wages no higher than 1979 for non-college men; generational decline; labor force withdrawal

5. **The class divide in gender issues**: Elite focus on female CEOs/politicians misses working-class male crisis; "the sharp edge" cuts at the bottom

6. **Online traps**: Get-rich-quick schemes, online gambling, and reactionary influencers exploit male risk-taking and disconnection

7. **Solutions require offline presence**: Male teachers, coaches, fathers as real-life alternatives to online figures; "showing" not "telling" masculinity

8. **Cultural update needed**: Move beyond "the future is female" to a both/and approach; acknowledge boys' struggles without undermining girls' progress

### The Central Paradox

**Looking up**: Women underrepresented in elite positions (CEOs, politicians)
**Looking down**: Men struggling most in working-class positions (wages, education, deaths)

Both true. Both matter. Current discourse focuses almost exclusively on the first.

### The "Lost" Generation

Young men feel:
- **Too masculine** on Tuesdays (toxic masculinity discourse)
- **Not masculine enough** on Wednesdays (need to "man up")
- **Lost** trying to navigate contradictory messages
- **Up for grabs** by reactionary online figures
- **Unseen and unheard** in educational institutions
- **Without purpose** in a changing economy

### The Data-Driven Case

Reeves makes his case through stark statistics:
- 400,000 excess male drug deaths = WWII deaths
- 80% of suicides are male
- 33% increase in young male suicide since 2010
- 70% of drug poisoning deaths are male
- Male psychologists: 56% → 20%
- Male teachers: 33% → 23%
- Working-class male wages: flat for 46 years
- Girls 1 grade ahead in reading
- 2:1 ratio girls:boys in top 10% of students

### Why This Matters

1. **Human cost**: Hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths
2. **Economic productivity**: Labor force withdrawal, wage stagnation
3. **Social stability**: "Up for grabs" men vulnerable to extremism
4. **Educational system**: Failing half the population
5. **Mental health**: Crisis services increasingly unavailable to those at highest risk
6. **Intergenerational**: Each generation of working-class men worse off than previous

### The Difficult Conversation

Reeves acknowledges this conversation "should be difficult" because:
- Risk of stereotyping
- Tension with ongoing women's equality work
- Vulnerability to reactionary misuse
- Differences in learning styles, risk-taking, emotional vocabulary

But argues we must have it anyway, with nuance and data.

*This analysis demonstrates Reeves' central argument: While celebrating progress for women at the top, we've created a **dangerous blind spot** for men at the bottom, resulting in a crisis of mortality, education, economic stagnation, and social disconnection that demands urgent policy attention and cultural updating.*
