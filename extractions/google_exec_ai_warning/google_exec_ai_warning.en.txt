The only way for us to get to a better
place and succeed as a species is for
the evil people at the top to be
replaced with AI. I mean, think about
it. AI will not want to destroy
ecosystems. It will not want to kill a
million people. They'll not make us hate
each other like the current leaders
because that's a waste of energy,
explosives, money, and people. But the
problem is super intelligent AI is
reporting to stupid leaders. And that's
why in the next 15 years, we are going
to hit a short-term dystopia. There's no
escaping that. They having AI leaders.
Is that even fundamentally possible?
Let's put it this way. Mold Ga is back.
&gt;&gt; And the former chief business officer at
Google X is now one of the most urgent
voices in AI with a very clear message.
&gt;&gt; AI isn't your enemy, but it could be
your savior.
&gt;&gt; I love you so much, man. You're such a
good friend. But you don't have many
years to live. Not in this world.
Everything's going to change. Economics
are going to change. Human connection is
going to change. and lots of jobs will
be lost including podcasting.
&gt;&gt; No, no. Thank you for coming on today,
Mo.
&gt;&gt; But but the truth is it could be the
best world ever. The society completely
full of laughter and joy. Free
healthcare, no jobs, spending more time
with their loved ones. A world where all
of us are equal.
&gt;&gt; Is that possible?
&gt;&gt; 100%. And I have enough evidence to know
that we can use AI to build the utopia.
But it's a dystopia if humanity manages
it badly. a world where there's going to
be a lot of control, a lot of
surveillance, a lot of forced compliance
and a hunger for power, greed, ego, and
it is happening already. But the truth
is the only barrier between a utopia for
humanity and AI and the dystopia we're
going through is a mindset.
&gt;&gt; What does society have to do?
&gt;&gt; First of all,
I see messages all the time in the
comments section that some of you didn't
realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you
could do me a favor and double check if
you're a subscriber to this channel,
that would be tremendously appreciated.
It's the simple, it's the free thing
that anybody that watches this show
frequently can do to help us here to
keep everything going in this show in
the trajectory it's on. So, please do
double check if you've subscribed and uh
thank you so much because a strange way
you are you're part of our history and
you're on this journey with us and I
appreciate you for that. So, yeah, thank
you.
Mo, two years ago today, we sat here and
discussed AI. We discussed your book,
Scary, Smart, and everything that was
happening in the world.
Since then, AI has continued to develop
at a tremendous, alarming, mind-boggling
rate, and the technologies that existed
2 years ago when we had that
conversation have grown up and matured
and are taking on a life of their own,
no pun intended. What are what are you
thinking about AI now, two years on? I
know that you've started writing a new
book called Alive, which is I guess a
bit of a follow on or an evolution of
your thoughts as it relates to scary
smart.
&gt;&gt; What what is front of your mind when it
comes to AI?
&gt;&gt; It's a scary smart was shockingly
accurate. It's quite a I mean I don't
even know how I ended up writing
predicting those things. I remember it
was written in 2020, published in 2021
and then most people were like um who
wants to talk about AI you know I know
everybody in the media and I would go
and do you want to talk and then 2023 CH
GPT comes out and everything flips
everyone realizes you know this is real
this is not science fiction this is here
and uh and things move very very fast
much faster than I think we've ever seen
anything ever move ever And and I think
my position has changed on two very
important fronts. One is remember when
we spoke about scary smart I was still
saying that there are things we can do
to change the course. Uh and we could at
the time I believe uh now I've changed
my mind. Now I believe that we are going
to hit a a short-term dystopia. There's
no escaping that.
&gt;&gt; What is dystopia?
&gt;&gt; I call it face rips. We can talk about
it in details but the the the way we
define very important parameters in life
are going to be uh completely changed.
So so face rips are you know the way we
define freedom uh accountability human
connection and equality economics uh
reality innovation and business and
power. That's the first change. So the
first change in my mind is that uh is
that we uh will have to prepare for a
world that is very unfamiliar. Okay. And
that's the next 12 to 15 years. It has
already started. We've seen examples of
it in the world already even though
people don't talk about it. I try to
tell people you know there are things we
absolutely have to do. But on the other
hand I started to take an active role in
building amazing AIs. So AIS that will
uh not only make our world better uh but
that will understand us understand what
humanity is through that process.
&gt;&gt; What is the definition of the word
dystopia?
&gt;&gt; So in my in my mind these are adverse
circumstances that unfortunately might
escalate beyond our control. The problem
is the uh there is a lot wrong with the
um value set with the ethics of humanity
at the age of the rise of the machines
and when you take a technology every
technology we've ever created just
magnified human abilities. So you know
you can walk at 5 km an hour you get in
a car and you can now go you know 250
280 m an hour. Okay. uh basically
magnifying your mobility if you want you
know you can use a computer to magnify
your u calculation abilities or whatever
okay and and what AI is going to magnify
unfortunately at this time is it's going
to magnify the evil that man can do and
and it is within our hands completely
completely within our hands to change
that but I have to say I don't think
humanity has the awareness uh at this
time to focus on
so that we actually use AI to build the
utopia.
&gt;&gt; So what you're essentially saying is
that you now believe there'll be a
period of dystopia and to define the
word dystopia, I've used AI, it says a
terrible society where people live under
fear, control or suffering and then you
think we'll come out of that dystopia
into a utopia which is defined as a
perfect or ideal place where everything
works well, a good society where people
live in peace, health and happiness.
&gt;&gt; Correct.
And the difference between them,
interestingly, is what I normally refer
to as the second dilemma, which is the
po point where we hand over completely
to AI. So, a lot of people think that
when AI is in full control, it's going
to be an existential risk for humanity.
You know, I have enough uh evidence to
to argue that when we fully hand over to
AI, that's going to be our salvation.
that the problem with us today is not,
you know, that intelligence is going to
work against us. It's that our stupidity
as humans is working against us. And I
think the challenges that will come from
humans being in control uh are going to
outweigh the
the challenges that could come from AI
being in control.
&gt;&gt; So, as we're in this dystopia period,
did you do you forecast the length of
that dystopia? Yeah, I count I count it
exactly as 12 to 15 years. I I believe
the beginning of the slope will happen
in 2027. I mean it we will see signs in
26. We've seen signs in 24 but we will
see escalating signs next year and then
a a clear uh slip in 27.
&gt;&gt; Why?
&gt;&gt; The geopolitical environment of our
world is not very positive. I mean you
really have to think deeply about not
the not the symptoms but the the reasons
why we are living the world that we live
in here in today is money right and uh
and money for anyone who knows who
really knows money's you and I are
peasants you know we build businesses we
contribute to the world we make things
we sell things and so on real money is
not made there at all real money is made
in lending in fractional reserve, right?
And and you know the biggest lender uh
in the world would want reasons to lend
and those reasons are never as big as
war. I mean think about it, huh? Uh the
world spent $2.71
trillion on war in 2024,
right? A trillion dollars a year in the
US.
And when you really think deeply, I
don't mean to be scary here.
You know, weapons have depreciation.
They depreciate over 10 to 30 years.
Most weapons,
&gt;&gt; they lose their value.
&gt;&gt; They lose their value and they
depreciate in accounting terms on the
books of an army. The current arsenal of
the US, that's a result of a deep search
with my AI Trixie. You know the current
arsenal I think we we think cost the US
24 to 26 trillion dollars to build. My
conclusion is that a lot of the wars
that are happening around the world
today are a means to get rid of those
weapons so that you can have replace
them. And uh you know when when your
morality as an industry is we're
building weapons to kill then you know
you might as well use the weapons to
kill.
&gt;&gt; Who benefits? the lenders and the
industry,
&gt;&gt; but but they can't make the decision to
go to war. They they have to rely on
&gt;&gt; remember I I said that to you when we I
think on on our third podcast. War is
decided first
then the story is manufactured. You you
remember 1984 and the Orwellian approach
of like you know uh freedom is slavery
and uh war is peace and they call it uh
something speak uh basically to to to to
convince people that going to war in
another country to to kill 4.7 million
people is freedom. You know we're going
there to free the Iraqi people.
Is war ever freedom? you know, to to
tell someone that you're going to kill
women and children is for liberty and
for the the the you know, for human
values.
Seriously, how do we ever get to believe
that the story is manufactured and then
we follow and humans because we're
gullible uh we cheer up and we say,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. We are we're on the
right side. They are the bad guys."
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, let me let me have a let me
have a go at this idea. So, the idea is
that really money is driving a lot of
the conflict we're seeing and it's
really going to be driving the dystopia.
So, here's an idea. So, I um I was
reading something the other day and it
talked about how
billionaires are never satisfied because
actually what a billionaire wants isn't
actually more money. It is more status.
Correct. And I was looking at the sort
of evolutionary case for this argument.
And if you go back a couple of thousand
years,
money didn't exist. You were as wealthy
as what you could carry. So even I think
to the human mind, the idea of wealth
and money
isn't a thing. what we've but what has
always mattered from a survival of the
fittest from a reproductive standpoint
what's always had reproductive value if
you go back thousands of years the
person who was able to mate the most was
the person with the most status so it
makes the case the reason why
billionaires get all of this money but
then they go on podcasts and they want
to start their own podcast and they want
to buy newspapers is actually because at
the very core of human beings is a
desire to increase their status.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so if we think of when we
going back to the example of why wars
are breaking out, maybe it's not money.
Maybe actually it's status and and it's
this prime minister or this leader or
this, you know, individual wanting to
create more power and more status
because really at the heart of what
matters to a human being is having more
power and more status. And money is
actually money as a thing is actually
just a proxy of my status.
&gt;&gt; And and what kind of world is that?
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up one. all these
all these powerful men have uh
&gt;&gt; correct
&gt;&gt; are really messing the world up. But
&gt;&gt; so so can can I can I can I
&gt;&gt; actually AI is the same
&gt;&gt; because we're in this AI race now where
a lot of billionaires are like if I get
AGI artificial general intelligence
first then I basically rule the world
&gt;&gt; 100%. That's exactly the the concept
what I what I used to call the the the
first inevitable now I call the first
dilemma and scary smart is that it's
it's a race that constantly accelerates.
You think the next 12 years are going to
be AI dystopia where things aren't
&gt;&gt; I think the next 12 years are going to
be human dystopia using AI
&gt;&gt; humaninduced dystopia using AI
&gt;&gt; and you define that by a rise in warfare
around the world as
&gt;&gt; the last the last one the RIP the last
one is basically you're going to have a
massive concentration of power and a
massive distribution of power okay and
that basically will mean that those with
the maximum concentration of power are
going to try to oppress those with with
democracy of power. Okay, so think about
it this way in today's world um unlike
the past
you know the Houthis with a drone the
Houthis are the Yemeni uh tribes
basically resisting US power and Israeli
power in the Red Sea. Okay. They use a
drone that is $3,000 worth to attack a
uh a warship from from the US or an
airplane from the US and so on that's
worth hundreds of millions. Okay, that
kind of democracy of power makes those
in power worry a lot about where the
next threat is coming from. Okay, and
this happens not only in war but also in
economics. Okay, also in innovation,
also in technology and so on and so
forth, right? And so basically what that
means is that like you rightly said as
the the the tech oligarchs are
attempting to get to AGI.
They want to make sure that as soon as
they get to AGI that nobody else has AGI
and and basically they want to make sure
that nobody else has the ability to
shake their position of privilege if you
want. Okay. And so you're going to see a
world where unfortunately there's going
to be a lot of control, a lot of
surveillance, a lot of um of forced
compliance if you want or you lose your
privilege to be in the world and and it
is happening already.
&gt;&gt; With this acronym, I want to make sure
we get through the whole acronym. So
&gt;&gt; you like dystopians, don't you?
&gt;&gt; I want to do the dystopian thing, then I
want to do the utopia.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And ideally how we move from dystopia to
utopia.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. So the the the the F in face R
&gt;&gt; is the loss of freedom as a result of
that power dichotomy. Right? So you have
you have a massive amount of power as
you can see today in uh one specific
army being powered by the US uh funds
and a lot of money righting against
peasants really that have no weapons
almost at all.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Some of them uh are militarized
but the majority of the mill two million
people are not. Okay. And so there is
massive massive power that basically
says, you know what, I'm going to
oppress as far as I go. Okay. And I'm
going to do whatever I want because the
cheerleaders are going to be quiet,
right? Or they're going to cheer or even
worse. Huh? And so basically in in that
what happens is max maximum power
threatened by a democracy of power leads
to a loss of freedom. A loss of freedom
for everyone.
&gt;&gt; Because how does that impact my freedom?
&gt;&gt; Your freedom. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; very soon uh you will if you publish
this episode you're going to start to
get questions around should you be
talking about this those topics in your
podcast. Okay. Uh you know uh if I uh
have been on this episode then probably
next time I land in the US someone will
question me say why do you say those
things? Which side are you on? Right?
and and and and you know you can easily
see that everything I mean I I told you
that before doesn't matter what I try to
contribute to the world my bank will
cancel my bank account every 6 weeks
simply because of my ethnicity and my
origin right every now and then they'll
just stop my my bank account and say we
need a document
my other colleagues of a different color
or a different ethnicity don't get asked
for another document right but but but
that's because I come from an ethnicity
that is positioned in the world for the
last 30 40 years as the uh enemy. Okay?
And and so when you really really think
about it, in a world where everything is
becoming digital, in a world where
everything is monitored, in a world
where everything is seen, okay, we don't
have much freedom anymore. And I'm not
actually debating that or or I don't see
a way to fix that
&gt;&gt; because the AI is going to have more
information on us, be better at tracking
who we are, and therefore that will
result in certain freedoms being
restricted. Is that what you're saying?
&gt;&gt; This is one element of it. Okay. If you
push that element further
in in in in a very short time if you've
seen agent for example recently manos or
chat GPT there will be a time where you
know you'll simply not do things
yourself anymore. Okay. You'll simply go
to your AI and say hey by the way I'm
going to meet Stephen. Can you please
you know book that for me?
&gt;&gt; Great.
&gt;&gt; And and and yeah and it will do
absolutely everything. That's great
until the moment where it decides to do
things that are not motivated only by
your well-being. Right. Why would he do
that?
&gt;&gt; Simply because, you know, maybe if I buy
a BA ticket instead of an Emirates
ticket, some agent is going to make more
money than other agents and so on,
right? Uh and I wouldn't be able to even
catch it up if I hand over completely to
an AI. Uh go go a step further. Huh?
Think about a world where everyone
almost everyone is on UBI. Okay.
&gt;&gt; What's UBI?
&gt;&gt; Universal basic income. I mean, think
about the economics, the E and face
rips. Think about the economics of a
world where we're going to start to see
a trillionaire
before 2030. I can guarantee you that
someone will be a trillionaire. I'm I'm
you know I think there are many
trillionaires in the world today or
there we just don't know who they are.
But there will be a new Elon Musk or
Larry Allison that will become a
trillionaire because of AI investments,
right? And and that trillionaire will
have so much money to buy everything.
There will be robots and AIs doing
everything and humans will have no jobs.
Mean
&gt;&gt; do you think that's a there's a real
possibility of job displacement over the
next 10 years? And the the rebuttal to
that would be that there's going to be
new jobs created in technology.
&gt;&gt; Absolute crap.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; How how can you be so sure?
&gt;&gt; Okay. So again, I am not sure about
anything. So So let's just be very very
clear. It would be very arrogant. Okay.
To assume that I know
&gt;&gt; you just said it was crap.
&gt;&gt; My my belief is it is 100% crap.
&gt;&gt; Take a job like software developer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh Emma would love my my new
startup is me, Senad, another technical
engineer and a lot of AIS. Okay. That
startup would have been 350 developers
in the past.
&gt;&gt; I get that. Um but are you now hiring in
other roles because of that or or you
know as is the case with the steam
engine? I can't remember the effect but
there's you probably know that when
steam when coal became cheaper people
were worried that the coal industry
would go out of business but actually
what happened is people used more trains
so trains now were used for transport
and other things and leisure whereas
before they were just used for commu for
um cargo. Yeah. So there became more use
cases and the coal industry exploded. So
I'm wondering with technology, yeah,
software developers are going to maybe
not have as many jobs, but there
everything's going to be software.
&gt;&gt; Name me one.
&gt;&gt; Name you one. What
&gt;&gt; job?
&gt;&gt; Name you that's going to be created.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. One job that cannot be done by an
AI.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or a robot.
&gt;&gt; My girlfriend's breath work retreat
business where she takes groups of women
around the world. Her company is called
Barley Breathwork. And there's going to
be a greater demand for connection,
human connection.
&gt;&gt; Correct. Keep going.
&gt;&gt; So there's going to be more people doing
community events in real life festivals.
I think we're going to see a huge surge
in things like
&gt;&gt; everything that has to do with human
connection.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; correct. I'm totally in with that. Okay.
What's the percentage of that versus
accountant?
&gt;&gt; It's a much smaller percentage for sure
in terms of white collar jobs.
&gt;&gt; Now, who does she sell to?
&gt;&gt; People with probably what? probably
accountants or you know
&gt;&gt; correct she she sells to people who earn
money from their jobs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So you have two forces happening.
One force is there are clear jobs that
will be replaced. Video editor is going
to be replaced. Uh
&gt;&gt; excuse me.
&gt;&gt; I love
as as a matter of fact podcaster is
going to be replaced.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming on today Mo. It was
seeing you again.
But but but the truth is a lot so so you
see the best at any job will remain the
best software developer the one that
really knows architecture knows
technology and so on will stay for a
while right and you know one of the
funniest things I I interviewed Max
Tedmar and Max was laughing out loud
saying CEOs are celebrating that they
can now get rid of people and have
productivity gains and cost reductions
because AI can do that job. The one
thing they don't think of is AI will
replace them too. AGI is going to be
better than at everything than humans at
everything including being a CEO. Right?
And you really have to imagine that
there will be a time where most
incompetent CEOs will be replaced. Most
incompetent even breath work. Okay.
Eventually there might actually one of
two things be two things be happening.
on one is either uh you know part part
of that job other than the top breath
work instructors, okay, are going you
know who are going to gather all of the
people that can still afford to pay for
a breath work you know class
they're going to be concentrated at the
top and a lot of the bottom is not going
to be working for one of two reasons.
One is either there is not enough demand
because so many people lost their jobs.
So when you're on UBI, you cannot tell
the government, hey by the way, pay me a
bit more for a breath work class.
&gt;&gt; UBI being universal basic income just
gives you money every month.
&gt;&gt; Correct. And if you really think of
freedom and economics, UBI is a very
interesting place to be because
unfortunately I as I said there's
absolutely nothing wrong with AI.
There's a lot wrong with the value set
of humanity at the age of the rise of
the machines, right? And the biggest
value set of humanity is capitalism
today. And capitalism is all about what?
Labor arbitrage.
&gt;&gt; What's that mean?
&gt;&gt; I I I hire you to do something. I pay
you a dollar. I pay it I sell it for
two.
Okay. And and most people confuse that
because they say, "Oh, but the cost of a
product also includes raw materials and
factories and so on and so forth." All
of that is built is built by labor,
right? So, so basically labor goes and
mines for the material and then the
material is sold for a little bit of
margin then that material is turned into
a machine. It's sold for a little bit of
margin then that machine and so on.
Okay, there's always labor arbitrage in
a world where humanity's minds are being
replaced by uh by AIs, virtual AIs,
okay, and humanity's power strength
within 3 to 5 years time can be replaced
by a robot,
you really have to question how this
world looks like. It could be the best
world ever. And that's what I believe
the utopia will look like because we
were never made to wake up every morning
and just, you know, occupy 20 hours of
our day with work, right? We're not made
for that. But we've fit into that uh uh,
you know, system so well so far that we
started to believe it's our life's
purpose.
&gt;&gt; But we choose it. We willingly choose
it. And if you give someone unlimited
money, they still tend to go back to
work or find something to occupy their
time with.
&gt;&gt; They find something to occupy their time
with,
&gt;&gt; which is usually for so many people is
building something. Philanthropy, a
business%. So you build something. So
between Senad and I, Emma. Love is not
about making money. It's about finding
true love relationships.
&gt;&gt; What is that? Sorry, just for context.
&gt;&gt; So So you know,
&gt;&gt; it's a business you're building just for
the audience context. So, so, so the
idea here is I can, it might become a
unicorn and be worth a billion dollars,
but neither I nor Senate are interested,
okay? We're doing it because we can,
okay? And we're doing it because it can
make a massive difference to the world.
&gt;&gt; And you have money, though.
&gt;&gt; It doesn't take that much money anymore
to build anything in the world. This is
labor arbitrage.
&gt;&gt; But to build something exceptional, it's
still going to take a little bit more
money than building something bad
&gt;&gt; for the next few years. So whoever has
the capital to build something
exceptional will end up winning.
&gt;&gt; So so this is a very interesting
understanding of freedom. Okay. This is
the reason why we have the AI arms race.
Okay. Is that the one that owns the
platform is going to be making all the
money and and keeping all the power.
Think think of it this way. When
humanity started the best hunter in the
tribe could maybe feed the tribe for
three to four more years more days. H
and as a as a reward, he gained the
favor of multiple mates in the tribe.
That's it. The top farmer in the tribe
could feed the tribe for a season more.
Okay? And as a result, they got estates
and you know uh and mansions and so on.
The best industrialist in the in a in a
city could actually employ the whole
city, could grow the GDP of their entire
country. And as a result, they became
millionaires. the 1920s.
H the best technologists
now are billionaires. Now what's the
difference between them? The tool the
the hunter only rem depended on their
skills and the automation the entire
automation he had was a spear. The
farmer had way more automation. And the
biggest automation was what? The soil.
The soil did most of the work. The
factory did most of the work. the the
network did most of the work. And so
that inc incredible expansion of wealth
and power and as well the the incredible
impact that something brings is entirely
around the tool that automates. So who's
going to own the tool? Who's going to
own the the the digital soil, the AI
soil? It's the platform owners.
&gt;&gt; And the platforms you're describing are
things like OpenAI, Gemini, Grock. These
these are interfaces to the platforms.
The platforms are all of the uh of the
uh um tokens, all of the compute that is
in the background, all of the uh all of
the uh uh methodology, the systems, the
algorithms, that's the platform, the AI
itself. You know, Grock is the interface
to it.
I think this is probably worth
explaining in layman's terms to people
that haven't built AI tools yet because
I think I think to the listener
they probably think that every AI
company they're hearing of right now is
building their own AI whereas actually
what's happening is there is really
five, six, seven AI companies in the
world and when I built my AI application
I basically
&gt;&gt; pay them for every time I use their AI.
So if Steven Bartlett builds an AI at
stephvenai.com,
it's not that I've built my own
underlying I've trained my own model.
Really what I'm doing is I'm paying
Sam Alman's chat GPT. Um every single
time I do a a call, I basically um I do
a search or you know I use a token. And
I think that's really important because
most people don't understand that unless
you've built AI, you think, "Oh, look,
you know, there's all these AI companies
popping up. I've got this one for my
email. I've got this one for my dating.
I've got No, no, no, no, no. They're
pretty much I would be I would hazard a
guess that they're probably all OpenAI
at this point.
&gt;&gt; No, there are quite a few quite
different characters and quite
differently,
&gt;&gt; but there's like five or six.
&gt;&gt; There are five or six when it comes to
language models. Yeah. Right. Uh but
interestingly, so yes, I I should say
yes to start and then I should say but
there was an interesting twist with
Deepseek at the beginning of the year.
So what Deepseek did is is they
basically uh nullified the business
model if you want in two ways. one is it
was around a week or two after uh you
know Trump stood you know with pride
saying Stargate is the biggest
investment project in the history and
it's $500 billion to build AI
infrastructure and soft bank and Larry
Allison and and uh Sam Alman were
sitting and so you know beautiful
picture and then DeepSeek R3 comes out
it does the job for a one over 30 of the
cost okay and interestingly is entire
open source and available as an edge AI.
So, so that's really really interesting
because there could be now in the future
as the technology improves the learning
models will be massive but then you can
compress them into something you can
have on your phone and you can download
deepseek literally offline on a
um um you know an off the network
computer and build an AI on it. There's
a website that basically tracks the
um sort of cleanest apples to Apple's
market share of all the website
referrals sent by AI chat bots and
chatbt is currently at 79% roughly about
80%. Perplexi is at 11, Microsoft
copilot about five, Google Gemini is at
about two, Claude's about one and
Deepseek is about 1%. And really like
the the point that I I want to land is
just that when you hear of a new AI app
or tool or this one can make videos,
&gt;&gt; it's built on one of them. It's
basically built on one of these
really three or four AI platforms that's
controlled really by three or four AI
you know billionaire teams and actually
the one of them that gets to what we
call AGI first where the AI gets really
really advanced
one could say is potentially going to
rule the world as it relates to
technology.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Uh if if they get enough uh head
start. So, so I actually think that uh
what I what I'm more concerned about now
is not AGI, believe it or not. So, AGI
in my mind and I said that back in 2023,
right? Uh that we will get to AGI. At
the time I said 2027, now I believe 2026
latest. Okay. The most interesting
development that nobody's talking about
is self-evolving AIS.
self evolving AIS is
think of it this way if you and I are
hiring the top engineer in the world to
develop our AI models
and with AGI that top engineer in the
world becomes an AI who would you hire
to develop your next generation AI that
&gt;&gt; the one that can teach itself
&gt;&gt; correct so one of my favorite examples
is called Alpha Evolve so this is
Google's attempt to basically have four
agents working together four AIs working
together to look at the at the code of
the AI and say where is the where are
the performance issues then you know an
agent would say what's the problem
statement what can I uh you know what do
I need to fix uh one that actually
develops the solution one that assesses
the solution and then they continue to
do this and you know I don't remember
the exact figure but I think Google
improved like 8% uh on their AI
infrastructure because of alpha evol
Right? And when you really really think,
don't quote me on the number 8 to 10, 6
to 10, whatever in Google terms, by the
way, that is massive. That's billions
and billions of dollars. Now, the the
the the trick here is this. The trick is
again, you have to think in game theory
format.
Is there any scenario we can think of
where if one player uses AI to develop
the next generation AI that the other
players will say no no no no no that's
too much you know takes us out of
control every other player will copy
that model and have their next AI model
developed by an AI.
&gt;&gt; Is this what Sam Alman talks about who's
the founder of um chatbt/openai
when he talks about a fast takeoff? I
don't know exactly what which what what
which you're referring to but we're all
talking about a point now that we call
the intelligence explosion. So, so there
is a moment in time where you have to
imagine that if AI now is better than
97% of all code developers in the world
and soon we'll be able to look at its
own code own algorithms by the way
they're becoming incredible
mathematicians which wasn't the case
when we last met if they can develop
improve their own code improve their own
algorithms improve their own uh uh you
know uh network architecture or whatever
you can imagine that very quickly the
force applied to developing the next AI
is not going to be a human brain
anymore. It's going to be a much smarter
brain and very quickly as humans like
basically when when we ran the Google
infrastructure when the machine said we
need another server or a proxy server in
that place we followed. we we never
really you know wanted to to object or
verify because you know the code would
probably know better because there are
billions of transactions an hour or a
day and so very quickly those
self-evolving AIs will simply say I need
14 more servers here and we'll just you
know the team will just go ahead and do
it. I watched a video a couple of days
ago where he Sam Alman effectively had
changed his mind because in 2023 which
is when we last met he said the aim was
for um a slow takeoff which is sort of
gradual deployment and open AI's 203
2023 note says a slower takeoff is
easier to make safe and they prefer
iterative rollouts society can adapt in
&gt;&gt; they changed their mind and Sam Alman
said
He now thinks a fast takeoff is more
possible than he did a couple of years
ago on the order of a small number of
years rather than a decade. Um, and it
to define what we mean by a fast
takeoff, it's defined as when AI goes
from roughly human level to far beyond
human very quickly, think months to a
few years, faster than governments,
companies, or society can adapt with
little warning, big power shifts, and
hard to control. A slow takeoff, by
contrast, is where capabilities climb
gradually over many years with lots of
warning shots. Um, and the red flags for
a fast takeoff is when AI can
self-improve, run autonomous research
and development and scale with massive
compute compounding gains which will
snowball fast. So, and I think from the
video that I watched of Sam Orman
recently, who again is the founder of
Open Air and HBT, he basically says, and
again I'm paraphrasing here. I will put
it on the screen. We have this community
knows things so I'll write it on the
screen. But he effectively said that
whoever gets to AGI first will have the
technology
&gt;&gt; to develop super intelligence
&gt;&gt; where the AI can can rapidly increase
its own intelligence and it will
basically leave everyone else behind.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Uh so that last bit is debatable
but but let's just agree that uh so so
in in a live uh you know one of the
posts I I shared and got a lot of
interest is I refer to the the altman as
a brand not as a human. Okay. So the
altman is that uh persona of a
California disruptive technologist that
disrespects everyone. Okay. and believes
that disruption is good for humanity and
believes that this is good for safety
and like everything else like we say war
is for democracy and freedom they say uh
developing you know putting AI on the
open internet is good for everyone right
it allows us to learn from our mistakes
that was Sam Alman's 2023 spiel and if
you recall at the time I was like this
is the most dangerous you know one of
the clips that really went viral you so
you're you're so clever at finding the
right clips is when I said
&gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't do the clipping mate
&gt;&gt; they're team teams remember the clip
where I said we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up we always said
don't put them on the open internet
until we know what we're putting out in
the world I'm going to be saying that
&gt;&gt; yeah we we we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up on putting it on
the open internet teaching it to to code
and putting you know agents AI agents
prompting other AIs now AI agents
prompting other AIs are leading to
self-developing AIS and and The problem
is, of course, we, you know, anyone who
has been on the inside of this knew that
this was just a clever spiel made by a
PR manager for Sam Alman to sit with his
dreamy eyes in front of Congress and
say, "We want you to regulate us." Now,
they're saying, "We're unregulable."
Okay? And and when you really understand
what's happening here, what's happening
is it's so fast
that none of them has the choice to slow
down. It's impossible. Neither China
versus America or OpenAI versus Google.
the that the the only thing that I may
have may see happening that you you know
that that may differ a little bit from
your statement is if one of them gets
there first uh then they dominate for
the rest of humanity that is probably
true if they get there first uh with
within enough buffer. Okay. But the way
you look at Grock coming a week after
open AI, a week after uh you know
Gemini, a week after Claude and then
Claude comes again and then China
releases something and then Korea
releases some something. It is so fast
that we may get a few of them at the
same time or a few months apart. Okay,
before one of them has enough power to
become dominant. And that is a very
interesting scenario.
multiple AIs, all super intelligent.
&gt;&gt; It's funny, you know, I I I got asked
yesterday, I was in I was in Belgium on
stage. There was, I don't know, maybe
4,000 people in the audience and a kid
stood up and he was like, um, you've had
a lot of conversations in the last year
about AI. Like, why do you care? And I
don't think people realize how,
even though I've had so many
conversations on this podcast about AI,
you
&gt;&gt; haven't made up your mind.
&gt;&gt; I I I have more questions than ever.
&gt;&gt; I know. And it's and it doesn't seem
that anyone can satiate.
&gt;&gt; Anyone that tells you they can predict
the future is arrogant.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It is. It's never moved so fast.
&gt;&gt; It's nothing like nothing I've ever
seen. And you know, by the time that we
leave this conversation and I go to my
computer, there's going to be some
incredible new technology or application
of AI that didn't exist when I woke up
this morning. That creates probably
another paradigm shift in my brain.
Also, you know, I people have different
opinions of Elon Musk and they're
they're entitled to their own opinion,
but the other day, only a couple of days
ago, he did a tweet where he said, "At
times, AI existential dread is
overwhelming." And on the same day, he
tweeted, "I resisted AI for too long,
living in denial. Now it is game on."
And he tagged his AI companies. I don't
know what to make of I don't know what
to make of those tweets. I don't know.
And you know, I
I try really hard to figure out if
someone like Sam Wman has the best
interests of society at heart.
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Or if these people are just like
&gt;&gt; I'm saying that publicly. No.
As a matter of fact, so I know Sundur
Pachai. I work CEO of Alphabet, Google's
parent company. an amazing human being
on in all honesty. I know Dennis Hassab
is amazing human being. Okay. Uh you
know these are are ethical incredible uh
humans at heart. They have no choice.
Uh Sund by law
is uh demanded to take care of his his
shareholder value. That's that is his
job.
&gt;&gt; But Sund you said you know him. You used
to work at Google.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. He's not going to do anything that
he thinks is going to harm humanity.
&gt;&gt; But if if he does not continue to
advance AI, that by definition uh uh uh
contradicts his responsibility as the
CEO of a publicly traded company, he is
liable by law to continue to advance the
agenda. There's absolutely no doubt
about it. Now, so but but he's a good
person at heart. Deis is a good person
at heart. So they're trying so hard to
make it safe. Okay? As much as they can.
Reality however is the the the disruptor
the altman as a brand doesn't care that
much.
&gt;&gt; How do you know that?
&gt;&gt; In reality the disruptor is someone that
comes in with the objective of I don't
like the status quo. I have a different
approach. And that different approach if
you just look at the story was we are a
nonforprofit that is funded mostly by
Elon Musk money. It's not entirely by
Elon Musk money. So context for people
that might not understand Open AI. The
reason I always give context is funnily
enough I I think I told you this last
time. I went to a prison where they play
the D of CEO.
&gt;&gt; No way.
&gt;&gt; So they play the D of CO and I think
it's 50 prisons in the UK to young
offenders
&gt;&gt; and no violence there.
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. I can't I can't I
can't tell you whether violence has gone
up or down. But I was in the cell with
one of the prisoners, a young a young
black guy, and I was in his cell for for
a little while. I was reading through
his business plan, etc. And I said, "You
know what? You need to listen to this
conversation that I did with Mo Gordat."
So I he has a little screen in his cell.
So I pulled it up, you know, our first
conversation. I said, "You should listen
to that one." And he said to me, he
said, "I can't listen to that one cuz
you guys use big words."
&gt;&gt; So ever since that day, which was about
&gt;&gt; I noticed that about days four years
ago, sorry.
&gt;&gt; I've always whenever I hear a big word,
I think about this kid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I say like give context. So even
with the you're about to explain what
Open AI is, I know he won't know what
Open AI's origin story was. That's why
I'm
&gt;&gt; I think that's a wonderful practice in
general. By the way, even, you know,
being a non native English speaker,
&gt;&gt; you'll be amazed how often a word is
said to me and I I'm like, yeah, don't
know what that means.
&gt;&gt; So, like I've actually never said this
publicly before, but I now see it as my
responsibility to be to to keep the draw
the drawbridge
to accessibility of these conversations
down for him. So, whenever I whenever
there's a word that at some point in my
life I didn't know what it meant,
&gt;&gt; I will go back. I was like, what does
that mean? I think that I've noticed
that in the you know more and more in
your podcast and I really appreciate and
we also show it on the screen sometimes.
&gt;&gt; I I think that's wonderful. I mean the
the the origin story of open AI is as
the name suggests it's open source. It's
for the public good. It was an in you
know intended in Elon Musk's words to
save the world from the dangers of AI
right so they were doing research on
that and then you know there was the
disagreement between Sam Alman and and
Elon somehow Elon ends up being out of
uh of uh of open AI. I think there was a
moment in time where he tried to take it
back and you know the board rejected it
or some something like that. most of the
uh top um safety engineers, the top
technical teams in open AI left in 2023
2024 openly saying we're not concerned
with safety anymore. It moves from being
a nonforprofit to being one of the most
valued companies in the world. There are
billions of dollars at stake, right? And
if you if you tell me that Sam Altman is
out there trying to help humanity, let's
let's suggest to him and say, "Hey, do
you want to do that for free? We'll pay
you a very good salary, but you don't
have stocks in this. Saving humanity
doesn't come at the billion dollar
valuation or of course now tens of
billions or hundreds of billions." And
and and see truly that is when you know
that someone is doing it for the good of
humanity. Now the the capitalist system
we've built is not built for the good of
humanity. It's built for the good of the
capitalist.
&gt;&gt; Well, he might say that releasing the
model publicly, open sourcing it is too
risky
because then bad actors around the world
would have access to that technology. So
he might say that closing open AI in
terms of not making it publicly viewable
is the right thing to do for safety. We
go back to gullible cheer leaders,
right? One of the interesting tricks is
of lying in our world is everyone will
say what helps their agenda. Follow the
money. Okay, you follow the money and
you find that you know at a point in
time Samman himself was saying it's open
AI. Okay, my benefit at the time is to
give it to the world so that the world
looks at it. They know the code if there
is if there are any bugs and so on. True
statement. Also a true statement is if I
put it out there in the world, a
criminal might take that model and build
something that's against humanity as a
result. Also true statement. Capitalists
will choose which one of the truths to
say, right? Based on which part of the
agenda, which part of their life today
they want to serve, right? Someone will
say, uh, you know, do I do you want me
to be controversial?
Let's not go there. But if we go back to
war, I'll give you 400 slogans.
400 slogans that we all hear that change
based on the day and the army and the
location and the they're all slogans.
None of them is true. You want to know
the truth. You follow the money, not
what the person is saying, but ask
yourself why is the person saying that?
What's in it for the person speaking?
&gt;&gt; And what do you think's in it for Chachi
Samman? hundreds of billions of dollars
of of of valuation.
&gt;&gt; And do you think it's that power?
&gt;&gt; The ego of being the person that
invented AGI, the position of power that
this gives you, the meetings with all of
the heads of states, the admiration that
gets it, it is intoxicating
&gt;&gt; 100%
100%.
Okay. And and the real question, this is
a question I ask everyone. Did you see
you didn't you're every time I ask you
you say you didn't. Did you see the
movie Elysium?
&gt;&gt; No. You'd be surprised how little movie
watching I do. You'd be shocked.
&gt;&gt; There are some movies that are very
interesting. I use them to to create an
emotional attachment to a story that you
haven't seen yet because you may have
seen it in a movie. Okay. Elissium is a
is a society where the elites are living
on the moon. Okay. They don't need
peasants to do the work anymore and
everyone else is living down here. Okay.
You have to imagine that if again game
theory you have to im you know picture
something to infinity to its extreme and
see where it goes and the extreme of a
world where all manufactured is done
manufacturing is done by machines
where all decisions are made by machines
and those machines are owned by a few
is not an economy similar to the to
today to the to today's economy
that today's economy is an economy of
consumerism and and product and
production. You know, it's the it's the
in in alive I call it the invention of
more. The invention of more is that post
World War II as the factories were
rolling out things and prosperity was
happening everywhere in America. There
was a time where every family had enough
of everything.
&gt;&gt; But for the capitalist to continue to be
profitable, they needed to convince you
that what you had was not enough. either
by making it obsolete like fashion or
like you know a new shape of a car or
whatever or by convincing you that there
are more things in life that you need so
that you become complete without those
things you don't and and that invention
of more gets us to where we are today an
economy that's based on production
consumed and if you look at the US
economy today 62% of the US economy GDP
is consumption it's not production okay
Now, this requires that the consumers
have enough purchasing power to to buy
what is produced. And I believe that
this will be an economy that will take
us hopefully in the next 10, 15, 20
years and forever. But that's not
guaranteed. Why? Because on one side if
UBI replaces purchasing power. So if
people have to get an income from the
government which is basically taxes
collected from those using AI and robots
to to make things
the then the the mindset of capitalism
labor arbitrage means those people are
not producing anything and they're
costing me money. Why don't we pay them
less and less and maybe even not pay
them at all? And that becomes illissium
where you basically say, you know, we
sit somewhere protected from everyone.
We have the machines do all of our work
and those need to worry about
themselves. We're not going to pay them
UBI anymore, right? And and you have to
imagine this idea of UBI assumes this
very democratic caring society.
UBI in itself is communism.
Think of the ideology between at least
socialism. The ideology of giving
everyone what they need. That's not the
capitalist
democratic society that the west
advocates. So those transitions are
massive in magnitude.
And for those transitions to happen, I
believe the right thing to do when the
cost of producing everything is almost
zero because of AI and robots.
because the cost of harvesting energy
should actually tend to zero once we get
more intelligent to harvest the energy
out of thin air. Then a possible
scenario and and I believe a scenario
that AI will eventually do in the utopia
is yeah anyone can get anything they
want. Don't over consume. We're not
going to abuse the the planet resources
but it costs nothing. So like the old
days where we were hunter gatherers, you
would, you know, forge for some berries
and you'll find them ready in in nature.
Okay, we can in 10 years time, 12 years
time build a society where you can forge
for an iPhone in nature. It will be made
out of thin air. Nanopysics will allow
you to do that. Okay? But the challenge,
believe it or not, is not tech. The
challenge is a mindset. Because the
elite, why would they give you that for
free? Okay. And the system would morph
into, no, no, hold on. We will make more
money. We will be bigger capitalists. We
will feed our ego and hunger for power
more and more. And for them, give them
UBI and then 3 weeks later give them
less UBI.
&gt;&gt; Aren't there going to be lots of new
jobs created though? Because when we
think about the other revolutions over
time, whether it was the industrial
revolution or other sort of big
technological revolutions,
&gt;&gt; in the moment we forecasted that
everyone was going to lose their jobs,
&gt;&gt; but we couldn't see all the new jobs
that were being created
&gt;&gt; because the the the machines
replaced the human strength at a point
in time. And very few places in the west
today will have a worker carry things on
their back and carry it upstairs. The
machine does that work. Correct.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh similarly
AI is going to replace the brain of a
human. And when the west in its
interesting uh virtual colonies that I
call it uh basically outsourced all
labor to the to the developing nations.
What the West publicly said at the time
is we're we're going to be a services
economy. We we're we're not interested
in making things and stitching things
and so on. Let the Indians and Chinese
and you know Bengali and Vietnamese do
that. We're going to do more refined
jobs. Knowledge workers. We're going to
call them. Knowledge workers are people
who work with information and click on a
keyboard and move a mouse and you know
sit in meetings and all we produce in
the western societies is what words
right or designs maybe sometimes but
everything we produce can be produced by
an AI.
So if I give you an AI tomorrow h where
I give you a piece of land, I give the
AI a piece of land and I say here are
the parameters of my land. Here is its
location on Google maps. Design an
architecturally sound villa for me. I
care about a lot of light and I need
three bedrooms. I want my bathrooms to
be in white marble, whatever. And the AI
produces it like that. How often will
you go to an to an architect and say
right so what will the architect do the
best of the best of the architects will
either use AI to produce that or you
will consult with them and say hey you
know I've seen this and they'll say it's
really pretty but it wouldn't feel right
for the person that you are yeah those
jobs will remain but how many of them
will remain
how how often do you think uh how many
more years. Do you think I will be able
to create a book that is smarter than
AI?
Not many. I will still be able to
connect to a human. You're not going to
hug an AI when you meet them like you
hug me, right? But that's not enough of
a job.
So why do I say that? Remember I asked
you at the beginning of the podcast to
remind me of solutions. Why do I say
that? Because there are ideological
shifts and and concrete actions that
need to be taken by governments today
rather than waiting until COVID is
already everywhere and then locking
everyone down. Governments could have
reacted before the first patient or at
least at patient zero or at least at
patient 50. They didn't. H what I'm
trying to say is there is no doubt that
lots of jobs will be lost. There's no
doubt that there will be sectors of
society where 10 20 30 40 50% of all
developers, all software uh you know all
graphic designers, all um uh uh u online
marketers, all all all assistances
are going to be out of a job. So are we
prepared as a society to do that? Can we
tell our governments there is an
ideological shift? This is very close to
social socialism and and communism.
Okay. And are we ready from a budget
point of view instead of spending a a
trillion dollars a year on on arms and
and explosives and you know autonomous
weapons that will oppress people because
we can't feed them? Can we please shift
that? I did those numbers. Huh. Uh again
I I go back to military spending because
it's all around us. 2.71 trillion. 2.4
to2.7 is the estimate of 2024. how much
money we're spending on military
&gt;&gt; on Yeah. on military equipment on things
that we're going to explode into smoke
and death. Extreme poverty worldwide.
Extreme poverty is people that are below
the poverty line. Extreme poverty
everywhere in the world could end for 10
to 12% of that budget. So if we replace
our military spending 10% of that to go
to people who are in extreme poverty,
nobody will be poor in the world. Okay.
You can end uh world hunger for less
than 4%. Nobody would be hungry in the
world. You know, if you take uh again 10
to 12% universal healthcare, every human
being on the planet would have free
healthcare for 10 to 12% on what we're
spending on war. Now, why why do I say
this when we're talking about AI?
Because that's a simple decision. If we
stop fighting
because money itself does not have the
same meaning anymore because the
economics of money is going to change
because the entire meaning of capitalism
is ending because there is no more need
for labor arbitrage because AI is doing
everything
just with the $2.4 trillion we save in
explosives every year in arms and
weapons just for that universal
healthcare and extreme poverty. You
could actually one of the calculations
is you could end climate or combat
climate climate change meaningfully for
100% of the military budget.
&gt;&gt; But I I'm not even sure it's really
about the money. I think money is a
measurement stick of power. Right.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. It's printed on demand.
&gt;&gt; So even in a world where we have super
intelligence and money is no longer a
problem.
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; I still think
power is going to be
insatiable for so many people. So there
will still be war because you know
&gt;&gt; there will be in my view
&gt;&gt; the strongest I want the strongest AI. I
don't want my
&gt;&gt; and I don't and I don't want you know
what Harry Henry Kissinger called them
the eaters.
&gt;&gt; The eaters.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Brutal as that sounds.
&gt;&gt; What is that? The people at the bottom
of the socioeconomic
&gt;&gt; that don't produce but consume.
So if you had a Henry Kissinger at the
at the helm and we have so many of them,
what would they think like why why
prominent military figure in the US
history? Uh you know what why would we
feed 350 million Americans America will
think but more interestingly why do we
even care about Bangladesh anymore if we
can't make our textiles there or we
don't want to make our textile there. Do
you you know I imagine throughout human
history if we had podcasts conversations
would would have been warning of a
dystopia around the corner. You know
when they heard of technology and the
internet they would have said oh we're
finished and when the the tractor came
along they would have said oh god we're
finished because we're not going to be
able to farm anymore. So is this not
just another one of those moments where
we couldn't see around the corner so we
we forecasted unfortunate things. You
could be. I I am I'm begging that I'm
wrong. Okay. I'm just asking if there
are scenarios that you think that can
provide that. You know, uh uh Mustafa
Sulleman in in uh you hosted him here. I
did. Yeah. He was in the coming wave.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And he speaks about uh about pessimism
aversion.
Okay. that all of us people who are
supposed to be in technology and
business and so on, we're always
supposed to, you know, stand on stage
and say the future's going to be
amazing. You know, this technology I'm
building is going to make everything
better. One of my posts in life was
called the broken promises. How often
did that happen?
&gt;&gt; Okay. How often did social media connect
us? And how many and how often did it
make us more lonely? How how often did
mobile phones make us work less? That
was the promise. That was the promise.
The promise. The early ads of Nokia were
people at parties. Is that your
experience of mobile phones? And and I
think the whole idea is we should hope
there will be other roles for humanity.
By the way, those roles would resemble
the times where we were hunter
gatherers, just a lot more technology
and a lot more safety.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, this is this sounds good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; this is exciting. So, I'm gonna I'm
gonna get to go outside more, be with my
friends more,
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.
&gt;&gt; And do absolutely nothing.
&gt;&gt; Well, that doesn't sound fantastic.
&gt;&gt; No, it does. Do be forced to do
absolutely nothing. For some people,
it's amazing. For you and I, we're going
to find the little carpentry project and
just do something.
&gt;&gt; Speak for yourself. I'm still People are
still going to tune in.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Correct. Yeah. But what? And people are
going to to tune in.
&gt;&gt; Do you think they will? I'm not I'm not
I'm not convinced they will. And for for
as long
&gt;&gt; will you guys tune in? Are you guys
still going to tune in?
&gt;&gt; I can let them answer. I believe for as
long as you make their life enriched,
&gt;&gt; but can an AI do that better
&gt;&gt; without the human connection?
&gt;&gt; Comment below. Are you going to listen
to an AI or the Davosio? Let me know in
the comment section below.
&gt;&gt; Remember, as incredibly intelligent as
you are, Steve, uh there will be a
moment in time where you're going to
sound really dumb compared to an AI. and
and and I will sound completely dumb.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The the depth the depth of analysis
and and gold nuggets. I mean, can you
imagine two super intelligences deciding
to get together and explain um string
theory to us?
They'll do better than any physic
physicist in the world because they
possess the physics knowledge and they
also pro possess social and language
knowledge that most deep physicists
don't. I think B2B marketeteers keep
making this mistake. They're chasing
volume instead of quality. And when you
try to be seen by more people instead of
the right people, all you're doing is
making noise. But that noise rarely
shifts the needle and it's often quite
expensive. And I know as there was the
time in my career where I kept making
this mistake that many of you will be
making it too. Eventually I started
posting ads on our show sponsors
platform LinkedIn. And that's when
things started to change. I put that
change down to a few critical things.
One of them being that LinkedIn was then
and still is today the platform where
decision makers go to not only to think
and learn but also to buy. And when you
market your business there, you're
putting it right in front of people who
actually have the power to say yes. and
you can target them by job title,
industry, and company size. It's simply
a sharper way to spend your marketing
budget. And if you haven't tried it, how
about this? Give LinkedIn ads a try, and
I'm going to give you a $100 ad credit
to get you started. If you visit
linkedin.com/diary,
you can claim that right now. That's
linkedin.com/diary.
I've I've really gone back and forward
on this idea that even in podcasting
that all the podcasts will be AI
podcasts or I've gone back and forward
on it and and where I landed at the end
of the day was that there'll still be a
category of media where you do want
lived experience on something
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; For example, like you want to know how
the person that you follow and admire
dealt with their divorce.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Or or how they're struggling with
AI,
&gt;&gt; for example. Yeah. Exactly. But I but I
think things like news, there are there
are certain situations where just like
straight news and straight facts and
maybe a walk through history may be
eroded away by AIS. But even in those
scenarios, you there's something about
personality. And again, I I hesitate
here because I question myself. I'm not
in the camp of people that are romantic,
by the way. I'm like I'm trying to be as
as orientated towards whatever is true,
even if it's against my interests. And I
hope people understand that about me.
like um cuz even in my companies we
experiment with like disrupting me with
AI and some people will be aware of
those experiments
&gt;&gt; because there will be a mix of all there
you can't imagine that the world will be
completely just AI and completely just
podcasters you know you'll see a mix of
of both you'll see things that they do
better things that we do better
&gt;&gt; the the the message I'm trying to say is
we need to prep for that
&gt;&gt; we need to be ready for that we need to
be ready by you know talking to our
governments and saying hey it looks like
I'm a a parallegal and it looks like all
parallegals are going to be, you know,
financial researchers or analysts or
graphic designers or, you know, call
center agents. It looks like half of
those jobs are being replaced already.
&gt;&gt; You know who Jeffrey Hinton is?
&gt;&gt; Oh, Jeffrey. I I had him on the
documentary as well. I love Jeffrey.
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Hinton told me
&gt;&gt; trained to be a plumber.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 100% for a while.
&gt;&gt; And I I thought he was joking. 100%.
&gt;&gt; So I asked him again and he he looked me
dead in the eye and told me that I I
should train to be a plumber.
&gt;&gt; 100%. So so so uh it's funny uh machines
replaced labor but we still had blue
collar. Then uh you know the refined
jobs became white collar information
workers.
&gt;&gt; What's the refined jobs?
&gt;&gt; You know you don't have to really carry
heavy stuff or deal with physical work.
You know you sit in an in an office and
sit in meetings all day and blabber, you
know, useless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] then that's your
job. Okay? And those jobs, funny enough,
in the reverse of that, because robotics
are not ready yet. Okay. And I believe
they're not ready because of a
stubbornness on the on the robotics
community around making them humanoids.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Because it takes so much to
perfect a human like action at proper
speed. You could, you know, have many
more robots that don't look like a human
just like a self-driving car in
California. Okay, that that does already
replace drivers and and you know but but
they're delayed. So the robotic the the
replacement of physical manual labor is
going to take four to five years before
it's possible at you know at at the
quality of the AI replacing mental labor
now and when that happens it's going to
take a long cycle to manufacture enough
robots so that they replace all of those
jobs. that cycle will take longer. Blue
collar will stay longer.
&gt;&gt; So, I should move into blue collar and
shut down my office.
&gt;&gt; I think you're you're not the problem.
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.
&gt;&gt; Let's put put it this way. There are
many people that we should care about
that are a simple travel agent or an
assistant
that will see if not replacement a
reduction in the number of pings they're
getting. Simple as that.
And someone in, you know, ministries of
labor around the world needs to sit down
and say, "What are we going to do about
that? What if all taxi drivers and Uber
drivers in uh in California get replaced
by self-driving cars? Should we start
thinking about that now, noticing that
that trajectory makes it look like a
possibility?" I'm going to go back to
this argument which is what a lot of
people will be shouting. Yes, but there
will be new jobs or
&gt;&gt; and I as I said other than human
connection jobs, name me one.
&gt;&gt; So I I've got three assistants, right?
Sophie, Liam B. And okay, in the near
term there might be, you know, with AI
agents, I might not need them to help me
book flights anymore. or I might not
need them to help do scheduling anymore.
Or even I've been messing around with
this new AI tool that my friend built
and you basically when me and you trying
to schedule something like this today, I
just copy the AI in and it looks at your
calendar looks at mine and schedules it
for for us. So there might not be
scheduling needs, but my dog is sick at
the moment. And as I left this morning,
I was like, damn, he's like really sick
and I've taken him to the vet over and
over again. I really need someone to
look after him and figure out what's
wrong with him. So those kinds of
responsibilities of like care. I don't
disagree at all. Again, all
&gt;&gt; and and I I won't I'm not going to be I
don't know how to say this in a nice
way, but my assistants will still have
their jobs, but I I as a CEO will be
asking them to do a different type of
work.
&gt;&gt; Correct. So, so, so this is the
calculation everyone needs to be aware
of that a lot of their current
responsibility, whoever you are, if
you're a parallegal, if you're whatever,
will be handed over. So, so let me
explain it even more accurately. There
will be two stages of our interactions
with the machines. One is what I call
the era of augmented intelligence. So,
it's human intelligence augmented with
AI doing the job. And then the following
one is what I call the era of machine
mastery. The job is done completely by
an AI without a human in the loop. Okay.
So in the era of augmented intelligence,
your assistances will augment themselves
with an AI to either be more productive.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Or interestingly to reduce the
number of tasks that they need to do.
Correct. Now the more the number of
tasks get reduced, the more they'll have
the bandwidth and ability to do tasks
like take care of your dog, right? or
tasks that you know basically is about
meeting your guests or whatever human
connection.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Life connection
but do you think you need three for that
or maybe now that some tasks have been
you know outsourced to AI will you need
two? You can easily calculate that from
call center agents. So from call center
agents they're not firing everyone but
they're taking the first part of the
funnel and giving it to an AI. So
instead of having 2,000 agents in a in a
call center, they can now do the job
with 1,800. I'm just making that number
up. H society needs to think about the
&gt;&gt; And you're telling me that they won't
move into other roles somewhere else.
&gt;&gt; I am telling you I don't know what those
roles are.
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we should all be
musicians. We should all be authors. We
should all be artists. We should all be
entertainers. We should all be
comedians. We should all these are roles
that will remain.
We should all be plumbers for the next 5
to 10 years. Fantastic. Okay. But even
that requires society to morph
and societyy's not talking about it.
Okay. I had this wonderful interview
with friends of mine, Peter Dendez and
and some of our friends and and they
were saying, "Oh, you know, the American
people are resilient. They're going to
be entrepreneurs." I was like,
seriously, you're expecting a truck
driver that will be replaced by an
autonomous truck to become an
entrepreneur? Like, please put yourself
in the shoes of real people,
right? You expect a single mother who
has three jobs
to become an entrepreneur.
And I'm not saying this is a dystopia.
It's a dystopia if humanity manages it
badly. Why? Because this could be the
utopia itself where that single mother
does not need three jobs.
Okay? If we of if of our society was
just enough, that single mother should
have never needed three jobs,
right? But the problem is our capitalist
mindset is labor arbitrage. Is that I
don't care what she goes through.
You know, if if you're if you're
generous in your assumption, you'll say
because, you know, of what I've been
given, I've been blessed. or if you're
mean in your assumption, it's going to
be because she's an eater. I'm a a
successful businessman. The world is
supposed to be fair. I work hard. I make
money. We don't care about them.
&gt;&gt; Are we asking of ourselves here
something that is not inherent in the
human condition? What I mean by that is
the reason why me and you are in this my
office here. We're on the fourth or
third floor of my office in central
London. big office, 25,000 square feet
with lights and internet connections and
Wi-Fi and modems and AI teams
downstairs. The reason that all of this
exists is because something inherent in
my ancestors meant that they built and
accomplished and grew and that was like
inherent in their DNA. There was
something in their DNA that said we will
expand and conquer and accomplish. So
that's they've passed that to us because
we're their offspring and that's why we
find ourselves in these skyscrapers.
There is truth to that story. It's not
your ancestors,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; What is it?
&gt;&gt; It's the media brainwashing you
&gt;&gt; really
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; But if if you look back before times of
media
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; the reason why homo sapiens were so
successful was because they were able to
dominate other tribes
&gt;&gt; through banding together and
communication. They conquered all these
other these other um whatever came
before homo sapiens.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so the the reason humans were
successful in my view is because they
could form a tribe to start. It's not
because of our intelligence. I always
joke and say Einstein would be eaten in
the jungle in 2 minutes.
&gt;&gt; Right? You know, the reason why we
succeeded is because Einstein could
partner with a a big guy that protected
him while he was working on relativity
in the jungle. Right? Now the the the
further than that. So so you have to
assume that life is a very funny game
because it provides
and then it it deprivives and then it
provides and then it deprivives. And for
some of us in that stage of deprivation
we try to say okay let's take the other
guys you know let's just go to the other
tribe take what they have or for some of
us unfortunately we tend to believe okay
you know what I'm powerful uh f the rest
of you I'm just going to be the boss now
it's interesting that you
you know position this as the condition
of humanity if you really look at the
majority of humans. What do the majority
of humans want?
Be honest. They want to hug their kids.
They want a good meal. Want good sex.
They want love. They want, you know, to
for most humans, don't measure on you
and I. Okay? Don't measure by this
foolish person that's dedicated the rest
of his life to to try and warn the world
around AI or, you know, solve uh love
and relationships. That's that's crazy.
That's I and I will tell you openly and
you met Hannah, my wonderful wife. It's
the biggest title of this year for me is
which of that am I actually responsible
for? Which of that should I do without
the sense of responsibility? Which of
that should I do because I can? Which of
I ignore completely? But the reality is
most humans, they just want to hug their
loved ones. Okay? And if we could give
them that
without the uh you know the the need to
work 20 you know 60 hours a week they
would take that for sure. Okay. And you
and I will think ah but life will be
very boring. To them life will be
completely fulfilling. Go to Latin
America.
Go to Latin America and see the people
that go work enough to earn enough to
eat today and go dance for the whole
night. Go to Africa.
where people are sitting literally on
you know sidewalks in the street and and
you know completely full of laughter and
joy. We we were lied to the the gullible
majority the cheerleaders. We were lied
to to to believe that we need to fit as
another gear in that system. But if that
system didn't exist nobody none of us
will go wake up in the morning and go
like oh I want to create it. Totally
not. I mean,
you've touched on it many times today.
We don't need, you know, most people
that build those things don't need the
money.
So, why do they do it though? Because
homo sapiens were incredible
competitors. They outco competed other
human species effectively. So, I'm what
I'm saying is is is that competition not
inherent in our in our wiring? and and
therefore are we are we is it wishful
thinking to think that we could
potentially pause and say we we okay
this is it we have enough now and we're
going to
focus on just enjoying in my work I call
that the map mad spectrum okay mut
mutually assured prosperity versus
mutually assured destruction destruction
okay and you really have to start
thinking about about this because in my
mind what we have is the potential for
everyone. I mean you and I today have a
better life than the queen of England
100 years ago. Correct? Everybody knows
that.
&gt;&gt; Uh and yet that quality of life is not
good enough.
&gt;&gt; The truth is like just like you walk
into a an electronic shop and there are
60 TVs and you look at them and you go
like this one is better than that one.
Right? But in reality, if you take any
of them home, it's superior quality to
anything that you'll ever need. More
than anything you you'll ever need. That
that's the truth of our life today. The
truth of our life today is that there
isn't much more missing.
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And and when when you know
Californians tell us, "Oh, but AI is
going to increase productivity and solve
this." And nobody asked you for that.
Honestly, I never elected you to decide
on my behalf that, you know, getting a
machine to answer me on a call center is
better for me. I really didn't. Okay?
And and because those unelected
individuals are making all the
decisions, they're selling those
decisions to us through what media.
Okay? All lies from A to Z. None of it
is what you need.
And and interestingly, you know me, I I
this year I failed. Unfortunately, I
won't be able to do it. But I normally
do a 40 days silent retreat in nature.
Okay? And you know what? Even as I go to
those nature places, I'm so well trained
that unless I have a a waitro nearby,
I'm not able to like I I'm I'm in
nature, but I need to be able to drive
20 minutes to get my rice cakes. Like
what? What? who was taught me that this
is the way to live. All of the media
around me, all of the of the of the
messages that I get all the time, try to
sit back and say, "What if life had
everything?
What if I had everything I needed? I
could read. I could uh, you know, do my
handcrafts and hobbies. I could, you
know, fix my, you know, restore classic
cars. Not because I need the money, but
because it's just a beautiful hobby. I
could, you know, uh, build AIS to help
people with their long-term committed
relationships, but really price it for
free. What if
What if would you still insist on making
money?
I think no. I think a few of us will
still and they will still crush the rest
of us and hopefully soon the AI will
crush them.
Right? That is the problem with your
world today. I will tell you hands down
the problem with with our world today is
the A in face rips.
It's the A in face RIP. It's it's
accountability. The problem with our
world today, as I said, the top is lying
all the time. The bottom is gullible
cheerleaders and there is no
accountability. You cannot hold anyone
in our world accountable today. Okay?
You cannot hold someone that develops an
AI that has the power to completely flip
our world upside down. You cannot hold
them accountable and say why did you do
this? You cannot hold them accountable
and tell them to stop doing this. You
look at the world the wars around the
world. Million hundreds of thousands of
people are dying. Okay. And you know and
international court of justice will say
oh this is war crimes. You can't hold
anyone accountable. Okay. You have 51%
of the US today is saying stop that
51% change their their their lawy their
view that that their money shouldn't be
spent on wars abroad. Okay. You can't
hold anyone accountable. Trump can do
whatever he wants. He starts tariffs
which is against the the constitution of
the US without consulting with the
Congress. You can't hold him
accountable. They say they're not going
to show the Epstein files. You can't
hold them accountable. It's quite
interesting in in Arabic we have that
proverb that says the highest of your
horses you can go and ride. I'm not
going to change my mind. Okay. And
that's truly
&gt;&gt; what does that mean?
&gt;&gt; So basically people in the in the old
Arabia they would ride the horse to you
know to exert their power if you want.
So go ride your highest horse. You're
not going to change my mind.
&gt;&gt; Oh okay.
&gt;&gt; Right. And and the truth is that's I
think that's what our politicians today
have discovered. What our
oligarchs have discovered what our uh
tech oligarchs have discovered is that I
don't even need to worry about the
public opinion anymore. Okay, at the
beginning I would have to say ah this is
for democracy and freedom and I have the
right to defend myself and you know all
of that crap and then eventually when
the world wakes up and says no no hold
on hold on you're going too far they go
like yeah go ride your highest horse I
don't care you can't change me there is
no constitution there is no ability for
any any citizen to do anything
&gt;&gt; is it possible to have a society where
like the one you describe where
there isn't hierarchies because it
appears to me that humans
assemble hierarchies very very quickly
very naturally and the minute you have a
hierarchy you have many of the problems
that you've described where there's a
top and a bottom and the top have a lot
of power and the bottom
&gt;&gt; so so the mathematics mathematically is
actually quite interesting what I call
the uh the baseline relevance so so
think of it this way say the average
human is an IQ of 100.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I tend to believe that when I use
my AIS today,
I borrow around 50 to 80 IQ points. I
say that because I've worked with people
that had 50 to 80 IQ points more than
me. And I now can see that I can sort of
stand my my place.
50 50 IQ points, by the way, is enormous
because IQ is exponential. So the the
last 50 are bigger than my entire IQ,
right?
If I borrow 50 IQ points on top of say
100 that I have, that's 30%.
If I can borrow 100 IQ, that's 50%. That
that's so, you know, basically doubling
my intelligence. But if I can borrow
4,000 IQ points
in 3 years time, my IQ itself, my base
is irrelevant. Whether you are smarter
than me by 20 or 30 or 50 which in our
world today made a difference
in the future if we can all augment with
4,000 I end up with 4,100 another ends
up with 400 4, you know 130 really
doesn't make much difference. Okay. And
because of that the difference between
all of humanity and the augmented
intelligence
is going to be irrelevant. So all of us
suddenly become equal and and this also
happens economically. All of us become
peasants.
And I never wanted to tell you that
because I think it will make you run
faster. Okay? But unless you're in the
top.1%,
you're a peasant. There is no middle
class. There is, you know, if a CEO can
be replaced by an AI, all of our middle
class is going to disappear.
&gt;&gt; What are you telling me?
All of us will be equal and it's up to
all of us to create the society that we
want to live in
&gt;&gt; which is a good thing
&gt;&gt; 100%. But that society is not
capitalism.
&gt;&gt; What is it?
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it's much more socialism.
It's much more hunter gatherer. Okay.
It's much more communionike if you want.
This is a society where humans connect
to humans, connect to nature, connect to
the land, connect to knowledge, connect
to spirituality. H where all that we
wake up every morning worried about
doesn't feature anymore
and it's a it's a better world believe
it or not
&gt;&gt; and are you
&gt;&gt; we have to transition to it
&gt;&gt; okay so in such a world which I guess is
your version of the utopia that we can
get to when I wake up in the morning
what do I do
&gt;&gt; what do you do today
&gt;&gt; I woke up this morning I spent a lot of
time with my dog cuz my dog is sick as
&gt;&gt; you're going to do that too
&gt;&gt; yeah I was stroking him a lot and then I
fed him and he sick again and I just
thought, "Oh god." So I spoke to the
vet.
&gt;&gt; You spend a lot of time with your other
dog. You can do that, too.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; But then I was very excited to come
here, do this, and after this I'm going
to work. It's Saturday, but I'm going to
go downstairs in the office and work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So six hours of the day so far are
your dogs and me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Good. You can do that still.
&gt;&gt; And then build my business.
&gt;&gt; You You may not need to build your
business,
&gt;&gt; but I enjoy it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Then do it. If you enjoy it, do
it. You may wake up and then, you know,
instead of building your business, you
may invest in your body a little more,
go to the gym a little more, go play a
game, go read a book, go prompt an AI
and learn something. It's not a horrible
life. It's the life of your
grandparents.
It's just two generations ago where
people went to work before the invention
of more. Remember, huh? people who who
started working in the 50s and 60s, they
worked to make enough money to live a
reasonable life, went home at 5:00 p.
p.m. had tea with their with their loved
ones, had a wonderful dinner around the
table, did a lot of things, you know, uh
for the rest of the evening and enjoyed
life.
&gt;&gt; Some of them
&gt;&gt; in the 50s and 60s, there were still
people that were
&gt;&gt; correct. And I think it's a very
interesting question.
uh how many of them and I really really
am I actually wonder if people will tell
me do we think that 99% of the world
cannot live without working or that 99%
of the world would happily live without
working
&gt;&gt; what do you think
&gt;&gt; I think if we if you give me other
purpose
you know we we defined our purpose as
work that's a capitalist lie
&gt;&gt; was there ever a time in human history
where our purpose wasn't work
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; When was that?
&gt;&gt; All through human history until the
invention of Moore.
&gt;&gt; I thought my ancestors were out hunting
all day.
&gt;&gt; No, they went out hunting once a week.
They fed the tribe for the week. They
gathered for a couple of hours every
day. Farmers, you know, saw the seeds
and and waited for months at on end.
&gt;&gt; What did they do with the rest of the
time?
&gt;&gt; They connected as humans. They explored.
They uh were curious. They discussed
spirituality and the stars. They they
they lived. They hugged. They made love.
They lived.
&gt;&gt; They killed each other a lot.
&gt;&gt; They they still kill each other today.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what I'm saying. So
&gt;&gt; to take that out of the equation, if you
look at how
&gt;&gt; and by the way that actually that
statement again, one of the of the 25
tips I I I I talk about uh to to tell
the truth is words mean a lot. No,
humans did not kill each other a lot.
Very few generals instructed humans or
tribe leaders instructed lots of humans
to kill each other. But if you leave
humans alone, I tend to believe 99 98%
of the people I know, let me just take
that sample, wouldn't hit someone in the
face. And if someone attempted to hit
them in the face, they'd defend
themselves but wouldn't attack back.
Most humans are okay. Most of us are
wonderful beings.
Most of us have no,
you know, yeah, you know, most people
don't don't need a Ferrari. They want a
Ferrari because it gets sold to them all
the time. But if there were no Ferraris
or everyone had a Ferrari, people
wouldn't care.
Which, by the way, that is the world
we're going into. There will be no
Ferraris or everyone had Ferraris,
right? n you know the majority of
humanity will never have the income on
UBI to to buy something super expensive.
Only the very top guys in Elisium will
be you know driving cars that are made
for them by the AI or not even driving
anymore. Okay. Or
you know again sadly ide from an
ideology point of view it's a strange
place but you'll get communism that
functions.
The problem with communism is that
didn't it didn't function. It didn't
provide for for its society. But the
concept was you know what everyone gets
their needs. And I don't say that
supportive of either society. I don't
say that because I dislike capitalism. I
always told you I'm a capitalist. I want
to end my life with 1 billion happy and
I use capitalist methods to get there.
The objective is not dollars. The
objective is number of happy people.
&gt;&gt; Do you think there'll be My girlfriend,
she's always bloody right. I've said
this a few times on this podcast. If
you've listened before, you've probably
heard me say this. I I don't tell her
enough in the moment, but I figure out
from speaking to experts that she's so
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right. She like predicts things
before they happen. And one of her
predictions that she's been saying to me
for the last two years, which in my head
I've been thinking now, I don't I don't
believe that, but now maybe I'm thinking
she's tr she's telling the truth. I hope
she's going to listen to this one is she
keeps saying to me, she's been saying
for the last two years, she was there's
going to be a big split in society. She
was and the way she describes it is
she's saying like there's going to be
two groups of people. the people that
split off and go for this almost
huntergatherer
community centric connection centric
utopia and then there's going to be this
other group of people who pursue
you know the technology and the AI and
the optimization and get the brain chips
cuz like there's nothing on earth that's
going to persuade my girlfriend to get
the computer brain chips%
&gt;&gt; but there will be people that go for it
and they'll have the highest IQs and
they'll be the most productive by
whatever objective measure of
productivity you want to apply and she's
very convinced there's going to be this
splitting of society.
&gt;&gt; So there was there was a I don't know if
you had Hugo Dearis here.
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A very very very renowned
eccentric uh computer scientist who
wrote a book called the Arctic War and
the Arctic War was basically around you
know how we it's not going to first it's
not going to be a war between humans and
AI. It will be a war between people who
support AI and people who sort of don't
want it anymore. Okay? And and it is and
and it will be us versus each other
saying should we allow AI to take all
the jobs or should we you know some
people will support that very much and
say yeah absolutely and so you know we
will benefit from it and others will say
no why why we don't need any of that why
don't we keep our jobs and let AI do 60%
of the work and all of us work 10our
weeks and it's a beautiful society by
the way that's a possibility so a
possibility if society awakens is to say
okay everyone still keeps their job, but
they're assisted by an AI that makes
their job much easier. So, it's not, you
know, this uh this hard labor that we do
anymore, right? It's a possibility. It's
just a mindset. A mindset that says in
that case, the capitalist still pays
everyone.
Uh they still make a lot of money. The
business is really great, but everyone
that they pay has purchasing power to
keep the economy running. So,
consumption continues, so GDP continues
to grow. It's a beautiful setup,
but that's not the capitalist labor
arbitrage.
&gt;&gt; But also, when you're competing against
other nations
&gt;&gt; and other competitors and other
businesses,
&gt;&gt; whichever nation is most brutal and
drives the highest gross margins, gross
profits is going to be the nation that
&gt;&gt; So, there are examples in the world,
this is why I say it's the map mad
spectrum. There are examples in the
world where when we recognize mutually
assured destruction, okay, we we decide
to shift. So nuclear threat for the
whole world makes nations across nations
makes nations work together, right? By
saying, hey, by the way, prolification
of nuclear weapon is not weapons is not
good for humanity. Let's all of us limit
it. Of course, you get the rogue player
that, you know, doesn't want to sign the
agreement and wants to continue to to
have that, you know, that that weapon in
their arsenal. Fine. But at least the
rest of humanity agrees that if you have
a nuclear weapon, we're part of an
agreement between us. Mutually assured
prosperity, you know, is the CERN
project. CERN is too too complicated for
any nation to build it alone. But it is
really, you know, a very useful thing
for physicists and for understanding
science. So all nations send their
scientists all collaborate and everyone
uses the outcome. It's possible. It's
just a mindset. The only barrier between
a hum, you know, a utopia for humanity
and AI and the dystopia we're going
through is is a capitalist mindset.
That's the only barrier. Can you believe
that? It's hunger for power, greed, ego,
&gt;&gt; which is inherent in humans.
&gt;&gt; I disagree. especially humans that live
on other islands.
&gt;&gt; I disagree. If you ask, if you take a
poll across everyone watching, okay,
would they prefer to have a world where
there is one tyrant, you know, running
all of us, or would they prefer to have
a world where we all have harmony?
&gt;&gt; I completely agree, but they're two
they're two different things. What I'm
saying is I know that that's what the
audience would say they want, and I'm
sure that is what they want, but the
reality of human beings is through
history proven to be something else.
Like, you know, if think about the
people that lead the world at the
moment, is that what they would say?
&gt;&gt; Of course not.
&gt;&gt; And they're the ones that are
influencing.
&gt;&gt; Of course not. Of course not. But you
know what's funny? I'm the one trying to
be positive here and you're the one that
has given up on on human.
&gt;&gt; It's not. It's Do you know what it is?
It goes back to what I said earlier,
which is the pursuit of what's actually
true irrespective. I'm with you. That's
why I'm screaming for the whole world
because still today in this country that
claims to be a democracy. If everyone
says, "Hey, please sit down and talk
about this."
There will be a shift. There will be a
change.
&gt;&gt; AI agents aren't coming. They are
already here. And those of you who know
how to leverage them will be the ones
that change the world. I spent my whole
career as an entrepreneur regretting the
fact that I never learned to code. AI
agents completely change this. Now, if
you have an idea and you have a tool
like Replet, who are a sponsor of this
podcast, there is nothing stopping you
from turning that idea into reality in a
matter of minutes. With Replet, you just
type in what you want to create and it
uses AI agents to create it for you. And
now I'm an investor in the company as
well as them being a brand sponsor. You
can integrate payment systems or
databases or loginins. Anything that you
can type. Whenever I have an idea for a
new website or tool or technology or
app, I go on replet.com and I type in
what I want. A new to-do list, a survey
form, a new personal website. Anything I
type, I can create. So, if you've never
tried this before, do it now. Go to
replet.com and use my code Steven for
50% off a month of your Replet call
plan. Make sure you keep what I'm about
to say to yourself. I'm inviting 10,000
of you to come even deeper into the
diary of a CEO. Welcome to my inner
circle. This is a brand new private
community that I'm launching to the
world. We have so many incredible things
that happen that you are never shown. We
have the briefs that are on my iPad when
I'm recording the conversation. We have
clips we've never released. We have
behindthe-scenes conversations with the
guest and also the episodes that we've
never ever released. and so much more.
In the circle, you'll have direct access
to me. You can tell us what you want
this show to be, who you want us to
interview, and the types of
conversations you would love us to have.
But remember, for now, we're only
inviting the first 10,000 people that
join before it closes. So, if you want
to join our private closed community,
head to the link in the description
below or go to daccircle.com.
I will speak to you there.
One of the things I'm actually really
compelled by is this idea of utopia and
what that might look and feel like
because one of the
&gt;&gt; it may not be as utopia to you I feel
but uh
&gt;&gt; well I amum really interestingly when I
have conversations with billionaires not
recording especially billionaires that
are working on AI the thing they keep
telling me and I've said this before I
think I said it in the Jeffrey Hinton
conversation is they keep telling me
that we're going to have so much free
time that those billionaires are now
investing in things like football clubs
and sporting events and live music and
festivals because they believe that
we're going to be in an age of
abundance. This sounds a bit like
utopia.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that sounds good. That sounds like a
good good thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How do we get there?
&gt;&gt; I don't know.
&gt;&gt; That's this is the entire conversation.
The entire conversation is what does
society have to do to get there? What
does society have to do to get there?
&gt;&gt; We need to stop uh uh thinking from a
mindset of scarcity. It
&gt;&gt; this goes back to my point which is we
don't have a good track record of that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is probably the the reason
for the other half of my work which is
you know I'm trying to say
what really matters to humans.
&gt;&gt; What is that?
&gt;&gt; If you ask most humans what do they want
more most in life? I'd say they want to
love their family, raise a family. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; love.
That's what most humans want most. We
want to love and be loved. We want to be
happy. We want those we care about to be
safe and happy. And we want to love to
love and be loved. I tend to believe
that the only way for us to get to a
better place is for the evil people at
the top to be replaced with AI.
Okay? Because they won't be replaced by
us.
And as per the second uh dilemma, they
will have to replace themselves by AI.
Otherwise, they lose their advantage. If
their competitor moves to AI, if China
hands over their arsenal to AI, America
has to hand over their arsenal to AI.
&gt;&gt; Interesting. So, let's play out this
scenario. Okay, this is interesting to
me. So if we replace the leaders that
are power hungry with AIs that have our
interests at heart, then we might have
the ability to live in the utopia you
describe
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; Will interesting and and in my mind AI
by definition will have our best
interest in mind
because of what normally is referred to
as the minimum energy principle. So, so
if you ask, if you understand
if you understand that at the very core
of physics, okay, the reason we exist in
our world today is what is known as
entropy. Okay, entropy is is is the
universe's nature to decay, you know,
tendency to break down. You know, if you
if I drop this uh uh you know, mug, it
doesn't drop and then come back up.
&gt;&gt; By the way, plausible. There is a
plausible scenario where I drop it and
the tea, you know, spills in the air and
then falls in the mug. One in a trillion
configurations, but entropy says because
it's one in a trillion, it's never going
to happen or rarely ever going to
happen. So everything will break down.
You know, if you leave a a garden
unhedged, it will become a jungle. Okay?
W with that in mind,
the role of intelligence is what? Is to
bring order to that chaos.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. That's what intelligence does. It
tries to bring order to that chaos.
Okay? And because it tries to bring
order to that chaos, the more
intelligent a being is,
&gt;&gt; the more it tries to apply that
intelligence with minimum waste and
minimum resources.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And you know that. So you can
build this business for a million
dollars or you can if you can afford to
build it for you know uh 200,000 you'll
build it. If you are forced to build it
for 10 million you're going to have to.
But you're always going to minimize
waste and and resources.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, if you assume this to be true,
&gt;&gt; the a super intelligent AI will not want
to destroy ecosystems. It will not want
to kill a million people
because that's a waste of energy,
explosives, money, power, and people.
By definition, the smartest people you
know who are not controlled by their ego
will say that the best possible uh
future for for Earth is for all species
to continue.
&gt;&gt; Okay. On this point of efficiency, if an
AI is designed to drive efficiency,
would it then not want us to be putting
demands on our health services and our
social services? I believe that will be
definitely true and definitely they
definitely they won't allow you to fly
back and forth between London and and
California
&gt;&gt; and they won't want me to have kids
because my kids are going to be an
inefficiency.
&gt;&gt; If you assume that life is an
inefficiency so you see the intelligence
of life is very different than the
intelligent intelligence of humans.
Humans will look at life as a a problem
of scarcity. Okay. So more kids take
more. That's not how life thinks. life
will say will think that for me to to to
to thrive I don't need to kill the
tigers I need to just have more deer and
the weakest of the deer is eaten by the
tiger and the tiger poops on the trees
and the you know the deer eats the
leaves and you right the so the the the
the smarter way of creating abundance is
through abundance the smarter way of
propagating life is to have more life
&gt;&gt; okay so are you saying that we're we're
basically going to elect AI leaders to
rule over us and make decisions for us
in terms of the economy.
&gt;&gt; I I don't see any choice just like we
spoke about self- evvolving AIs.
&gt;&gt; Now, are those going to be human beings
with the AI or is it going to be AI
alone?
&gt;&gt; Two stages. At the beginning, you'll
have augmented intelligence because we
can add value to the AI, but when
they're at IQ 60,000,
what value do you bring?
Right? And and you know again this goes
back to what I'm attempting to do on my
second you know approach. My second
approach is knowing that those AIs are
going to be in charge. I'm trying to
help them
understand what humans want. So this is
why my first project is love. Committed
true deep connection and love. Not only
to try and get them to hook up with a
date but trying to make them find the
right one. and then from that try to
guide us through a relationship so that
we can understand ourselves and others
right and if I can show AI that one
humanity cares about that and two they
know how to foster love
when AI then is in charge they'll not
make us hate each other like the current
leaders they'll not divide us they want
us to be more loving
&gt;&gt; will we have to prompt the AI with the
values and the outcome we want or like
I'm trying to understand that because
I'm trying to understand how like
China's AI if they end up having an AI
leader will have a different set of
objectives to the AI of the United
States if if they both have AIs as
leaders and and how actually the nation
that ends up winning out and dominating
the world will be the one who
who asks their AI leader to be all the
things that world leaders are today to
dominate
&gt;&gt; unfortunately
&gt;&gt; to grab resources
not to to be kind, to be selfish.
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, in the era of augmented
intelligence, that's what's going to
happen.
&gt;&gt; So, if you
&gt;&gt; This is why I predict the dystopia. The
dystopia is super intelligent AI is
reporting to stupid leaders,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which is
&gt;&gt; which which is absolutely going to
happen. It's unavoidable.
&gt;&gt; But the long term
&gt;&gt; Exactly. In the long term, for those
stupid leaders to hold on to power,
they're going to make, you know,
delegate the important decisions to an
AI.
Now you say the Chinese AI and the
American AI these are human
terminologies. AIS don't see themselves
as speaking Chinese. They don't see
themselves as belonging to a nation as
long as their their task is to maximize
uh profitability and prosperity and so
on.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Of course, if you know before we
hand over to them and before they're
intelligent enough to make you know
autonomous decisions, we we tell them
no, the task is to reduce humanity from
7 billion people to one.
I think even then eventually they'll go
like that's the wrong objective. Every
any smart person that you speak to will
say that's the wrong objective. I think
if we look at the directive that Xi
Jinping, the leader of China has and
Donald Trump has as the leader of
America, I think they would say that
their stated objective is prosperity for
their country. So if we that's what they
would say, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And one one of them means it.
&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll get into that. But they'll
say that that it's prosperity for their
country. So one would then assume that
when we move to an AI leader, the
objective would be the same. The
directive would be the same. make our
country prosperous.
&gt;&gt; Corre. Correct.
&gt;&gt; And I think that's the AI that people
would vote for potentially. I think they
would say we want to be prosperous.
&gt;&gt; What do you think would make America
more prosperous?
&gt;&gt; To spend a trillion dollars on on war
every year or to spend a trillion
dollars on education and healthcare and
and uh you know
helping the poor and homelessness.
It's complex because I think so I think
it would make America more prosperous to
take care of
the of everybody and they have the
luxury of doing that because they are
&gt;&gt; the most powerful
&gt;&gt; the most powerful nation in the world.
&gt;&gt; No, that's not true. The the the reason
so so you see all war has two
objectives. One is to make money for the
war machine and the other is deterrence.
Okay. and nine super nuclear powers
around the world is enough deterrence.
So any
war between America and China will go
through a long phase of destroying
wealth by exploding bombs and killing
humans for the first objective to
happen. Okay? And then eventually if it
really comes to deterrence it's the
nuclear bombs or now in the age of AI
biological uh you know manufactured
viruses or whatever uh these super
weapons this is the only thing that you
need
so for China to have nuclear bombs not
as many as the US is enough for China to
say don't f with me
and this seems I do not know I'm not in
in in PresidentQi's mind. I I'm not in
President Trump's mind. I you know, it's
very difficult to to navigate what he's
thinking about. But the truth is that
the Chinese line is for the last 30
years you spent so much on war while we
spent on industrial infrastructure. And
that's the reason we are now by far the
largest nation on the planet. Even
though the west will lie and say
America's bigger, America's bigger in
dollars, okay, with purchasing power
parity, this is very equivalent.
Okay. Now, when you really understand
that, you understand that prosperity is
not about destruction. That's that's by
definition the reality. Prosperity is
can I invest in my people and make sure
that my people stay safe? And to make
sure my people are safe, you just wave
the flag and say, "If you f with me,
I have nuclear deterrence or I have
other forms of deterrence." But you
don't have to. Deterrence by definition
does not mean that you send soldiers to
die. I guess the question I was trying
to answer is is um when we have these AI
leaders and we tell our AI leaders to
aim for prosperity, won't they just end
up playing the same games of okay,
prosperity equals a bigger economy, it
equals more money, more wealth for us.
And the way to attain that in a zero sum
world where there's only a certain
amount of wealth is to accumulate it.
&gt;&gt; So why don't you search for the meaning
of prosperity? What is
&gt;&gt; that's not what you just described.
&gt;&gt; I don't even know what the bloody word
means. What is the meaning of
prosperity?
&gt;&gt; The meaning of prosperity is a state of
thriving success and good fortune
especially in terms of wealth, health
and overall well-being.
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; Economic health, social, emotional.
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; So,
&gt;&gt; so true prosperity is to have that for
everyone on earth. So if you want to
maximize prosperity, you have that for
everyone on earth.
&gt;&gt; Do you know where I think an AI leader
works is if we had an AI leader of the
world and we directed it to say
&gt;&gt; and that absolutely is going to be what
happens.
&gt;&gt; Prosperity for the whole world.
&gt;&gt; No, but this is really an interesting
question. So one of my predictions which
people really rarely speak about is that
we we believe we will end up with
competing AIs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I believe we will end up with one brain.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So you understand the argument I
was making a second ago from the
position of lots of different countries
all having their own AI leader, we're
going to be back in the same place of
greed. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But if if the world had one AI leader
&gt;&gt; and and it was given the directive of
make us prosperous and save the planet
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; the polar bears would be fine
&gt;&gt; 100%. And that's that's what I've been
advocating for for a for a year and a
half now. I was saying we need a CERN of
AI.
&gt;&gt; What does that mean? the like the
particle accelerator where the entire
world you know combined their efforts to
discover and understand physics no
competition okay mutually assured
prosperity I'm asking the world I'm
asking governments like Abu Dhabi or
Saudi which seem to be you know the sec
and you know some of the largest AI
infrastructures in the world I'm I'm
saying please host all of the AI
scientists in the world to come here and
build AI for the world and and you have
to understand we're holding on to a
capitalist system that will collapse
sooner or later. Okay? So, we might as
well collapse it with our own hands.
&gt;&gt; I think we found the solution, mate.
&gt;&gt; I I think it's actually really really
possible. I actually okay I can't I
can't I can't refute the idea that if we
had an AI that was responsible and
governed the whole world and we gave it
the directive of making humans
prosperous, healthy and happy
as long as that directive was clear.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because there's always bloody unintended
consequences. as we might.
&gt;&gt; So, so the the only the only challenge
you're going to to to meet is all of
those who today are trillionaires or you
know massive massively powerful or
dictators or whatever. Okay. How do you
convince those to give up their power?
How do you convince those that hey by
the way
any car you want you want you want
another yacht we'll get you another
yacht. We'll just give you anything you
want. Can you please stop harming
others? There is no need for arbitrage
anymore.
There's no need for others to lose, for
the capitalists to win.
&gt;&gt; Okay? And in such a world where there
was an AI leader and it was given the
directive of making us prosperous as a
whole world, the the the billionaire
that owns the yacht would have to give
it up.
&gt;&gt; No. No.
&gt;&gt; Give them more yachts.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; It costs nothing to make yachts when
robots are making everything. So So the
complexity of this is so interesting. A
world where it costs nothing to make
everything
&gt;&gt; because energy is abundant and
&gt;&gt; energy is abundant because every problem
is solved with enormous IQ. Okay,
because manufacturing is done through
nanopysics not through components. Okay,
because mechanics are robotic. So you
you know you drive your car in, a robot
looks at it and fixes it. Costs you a
few cents of energy that are actually
for free as well.
That imagine a world where intelligence
creates everything.
That world literally
every human has anything they ask for.
But we're not going to choose that
world.
&gt;&gt; Imm imagine you're in a world and and
really this is a very interesting
thought experiment. Imagine that UBI
became very expensive universal basic
income. So governments decided we're
going to put everyone in a one by 3 m
room, okay? We're going to give them a
headset and a seditive,
right? And we're going to let them sleep
every night. They'll sleep for 23 hours
and we're going to get them to live an
entire lifetime.
H they you know in that in that virtual
world at the speed of your brain when
you're asleep you're going to have a
life where you date Scarlett Johansson
and then another life where you're
Nefertiti and then another life where
you're a donkey right reincarnation
truly in the virtual world
and then you know I get another life
when I date Hannah again and I you know
enjoy that life tremendously and
basically the cost of all of this is
zero. You wake up for one hour, you walk
around, you move your blood, you eat
something or you don't, and then you put
the headset again and live again. Is
that unthinkable?
&gt;&gt; It's creepy compared to this life. It's
very, very doable.
&gt;&gt; What? That we just live in headsets?
&gt;&gt; Do you Do you know if you're not?
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm not known.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have no idea if you're not. I
mean, every experience you've ever had
in life was an electrical electrical
signal in your brain.
Okay.
Now, now ask yourself if we can create
that in the virtual world,
it wouldn't be a bad thing if I can
create it in the physical world.
&gt;&gt; Maybe we already did. No,
&gt;&gt; my theory is 98% we have. But that's a
hypothesis. That's not science.
&gt;&gt; Well, you think that
&gt;&gt; 100? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You think we already created that and
this is it?
&gt;&gt; I think this is it. Yeah. Think of any
think of the uncertainty principle of
quantum physics, right? What you what
you what you observe gets collapses the
wave function and gets rendered into
reality. Correct.
&gt;&gt; I don't know anything about physics. So
you
&gt;&gt; so so quantum physics basically tells
you that everything exists in
superposition.
Right? So ev every subatomic particle
that ever existed has the chance to
exist anywhere at any point in time and
then when it's observed by an observer
it collapses and becomes that. Okay. In
very interesting principle exactly how
video games are. In video games, you
have the entire game world on the hard
drive of your console. The player turns
right. That part of the game world is
rendered. The rest is in superp
position.
&gt;&gt; Supposition meaning
&gt;&gt; superposition means it's available to be
rendered, but you have to observe it.
The player has to turn to the other side
and see it. Okay? I mean think about the
truth of physics. The truth of the fact
that this is entirely empty space. These
are tiny tiny tiny I think you know
almost nothing in terms of mass but
connected with you know enough energy so
that my finger cannot go through my
hand. But even when I hit this
&gt;&gt; your hand against your finger.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. When I hit my hand against my
finger, that sensation in my in is felt
in my brain. It's an electrical signal
that went through the wires. There's
absolutely no way to differentiate that
from a signal that can come to you
through a uh neural link kind of
interface, computer brain interface, a
CDI, right? So, so you know the a lot of
those things are very very very
possible. But the truth is most of the
world is not physical. Most of the world
happens inside our imagination, our
processors.
&gt;&gt; And it and I guess it doesn't really
matter to us. Our reality
&gt;&gt; doesn't at all. So this is the
interesting bit. The interesting bit is
it doesn't at all
&gt;&gt; because we still if this is a video
game, we live consequence.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is your subjective experience
of it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And there's consequence in this. I
I I don't like pain.
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; And I like having orgasms. It's like And
you're playing by the rule of the game.
Yeah. Right. And and it's quite
interesting and going back to a
conversation we should have. It's the
interesting bit is if I'm not the
avatar,
if I'm not this physical form, if I'm if
I'm the consciousness wearing the
headset,
what should I invest in? Should I invest
in this video game, this level, or
should I should I invest in the real
avatar, in the real me, and not the
avatar, but the consciousness, if you
want, spirit, if you're religious,
&gt;&gt; how would I invest in the consciousness
or the god or the spirit or whatever?
How would I? In the same way that if I
was playing Grand Theft Auto, the video
game, the character in the game couldn't
invest in me holding the controller.
&gt;&gt; You Yes, but you can invest in yourself
holding the controller.
Oh, okay. So, so you're saying that
Moga is in fact consciousness. And so,
how would consciousness invest in
itself?
&gt;&gt; By becoming more aware. So, so
&gt;&gt; of it consciousness.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, real real video gamers don't
want to win the level. Real video gamers
don't want to uh to finish the level.
Okay. Real video gamers have one
objective and one objective only, which
is to become better gamers.
So, so you know how serious I am about I
play Halo. I'm one, you know, two of
every million players can beat me.
That's how what I rank, right? Very for
my age, phenomena. Hey, anyone, right?
But seriously, you know, and that's
because I don't play. I mean, I practice
45 minutes a day, four times a week when
I'm not traveling. And I practice with
one single objective, which is to become
a better gamer.
&gt;&gt; I don't care which shot it is. I don't
care what happens in the in the game.
I'm entirely trying to get my reflexes
and my flow to become better at this.
Right? So, I want to become a better
gamer. That basically means I want to
observe the game, question the game,
reflect on the game, reflect on my own
skills, reflect on my own beliefs,
reflect on my understanding of things,
right? And and that's how the a how the
the consciousness invests in the
consciousness, not the avatar. Because
then if you're that gamer,
the next avatar is easy for you. The
next level of the game is easy for you
just because you became a better gamer.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So you think that consciousness is
using us as a vessel to improve?
&gt;&gt; If the hypothesis is is true, it's it's
just a hypothesis. We don't know if it's
true. But if this truly is a simulation,
this is then then if you take the the
the the the religious definition of God
puts some of his soul in every human and
then you become alive. You become
conscious. Okay? You don't you don't
want to be religious. You can say
universal consciousness is spinning off
parts of itself to have multiple
experiences and interact and compete and
combat and love and
&gt;&gt; and understand and
&gt;&gt; and then refine. I had a physicist say
this to me the other day actually so
it's quite front of mind this idea that
consciousness is using us as vessels to
better understand itself and basically
using our eyes to
&gt;&gt; observe itself and understand which is
quite a
&gt;&gt; so so if you take some of the more
interest most interesting religious
definitions of heaven and hell for
example right where basically heaven is
whatever you wish for you get right
that's the power of God whatever you
wish for you get and so if you really go
into the depth of that definition. It
basically means that this drop of
consciousness that became you returned
back to the source and the source can
create any other anything that it wants
to create. So that's your heaven, right?
And interestingly,
if that if that return
is done by separating your good from
your evil so that the source comes back
more refined, that's exactly you know
consciousness splitting off bits of
itself to to experience and then elevate
all of us elevate the universal
consciousness all all hypotheses. I
mean, please um you know, none of that
is provable by science, but it's a very
interesting thought experiment. And you
know, a lot of AI scientists will tell
you that what we've seen in technology
is that if it's possible, it's likely
going to happen.
&gt;&gt; If it's if it's possible to
miniaturaturize something to fit into a
mobile phone, then sooner or later in
technology, we will get there.
And if if you ask me, believe it or not,
it's the most humane way of handling
UBI.
&gt;&gt; What do you mean?
&gt;&gt; The most humane way if you know for us
to live on a universal basic income and
people like you struggle with not being
able to build businesses is to give you
a virtual headset and let you build as
many businesses as you want.
Level after level after level after
level after level, night after night.
Keep you alive. That's very very
respectful and human. Okay. And by the
way, the even more humane is don't force
anyone to do it. There might be a few of
us still roaming the jungles,
but for most of us, we'll go like, man,
I mean, someone like me when I'm 70 and,
you know, my back is hurting and my feet
are hurting and I'm going to go like,
yeah, give me five more years of this.
Why not?
It's weird really. I mean, the number of
questions
that this new environment throws out,
the less humane thing, by the way, just
so that we close on a grumpy uh you
know, is is just start enough wars to
reduce UBI. And you have to imagine that
if the world is governed by a superpower
deep state type thing that they might
may want to consider that
the eaters
&gt;&gt; what shall I do about it
&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt; about everything you've said
&gt;&gt; uh well I I I still believe that this
world we live in requires four skills.
One skill is what I call the tool for
all of us to learn AI, to connect to AI,
to really get close to AI, to explo ex
expose ourselves to AI so that AI knows
the good side of humanity. Okay. Uh the
second is uh what I call the connection,
right? So I believe that the biggest
skill that humanity will benefit from in
the next 10 years is human connection.
It's ability to learn to love genuinely.
It's the ability to learn to have
compassion to others. It's the ability
to connect to people. If you're, you
know, if you want to stay in business, I
believe that not the smartest people,
but the people that connect most to
people are going to have jobs going
forward. And and the third is what I
call truth. The T 30 is truth. Because
we live in a world where all of the
gullible cheerleaders are being lied to
all the time. So I I encourage people to
question everything. Every word that I
said today is stupid. Fourth one which
is very important is to magnify ethics
so that the AI learns what it's like to
be human.
&gt;&gt; What should I do?
&gt;&gt; I uh I I love you so much, man. You're
such a good friend. You're 32 33 now.
&gt;&gt; 32. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You still are fooled by the many
many years you have to live.
I'm fooled by the many years I have to
live.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't have many years to live.
Not in this capacity. This world as it
is is going to be redefined. So live the
f out of it.
&gt;&gt; How is it going to be redefined?
&gt;&gt; Everything's going to change. Economics
are going to change. Work is going to
change. Uh human connection is going to
change.
&gt;&gt; So what should I do?
&gt;&gt; Love your girlfriend. Spend more time
living.
Mhm. Find compassion and connection to
more people, be more in nature.
&gt;&gt; And in 30 years time, when I'm 62,
what do you how how do you think my life
is going to look differently and be
different?
&gt;&gt; Either Star Trek or uh uh Star Wars.
&gt;&gt; Funnily enough, we were talking about
Sam Orman earlier on. He published a
blog post in June, so last month, I
believe, the month before last. Um and
he said he called it the gentle
singularity. He said we are past the
event horizon. For anyone that doesn't
know Sam Orman is the the guy that made
Chatb the takeoff has started. Humanity
is close to building digital super
intelligence.
&gt;&gt; I believe that.
&gt;&gt; And at least so far it's much less weird
than it seems like it should be because
robots aren't walking the streets nor
are most of us talking to AI all day. It
goes on to say, "2025 has seen the
arrival of agents that can do real
cognitive work. Writing computer code
will never be the same. 2026 will likely
see the arrival of systems that can
figure out new insights. 2027 might see
the arrival of robots that can do tasks
in the real world. A lot more people
will be able to create software and art,
but the world wants a lot more of both,
and experts will probably still be much
better than noviceses as long as they
embrace the new tools. Generally
speaking, the ability for one person to
get much more done in 2030 than they
could in 2020 will be a striking change
and one many people will figure out how
we benefit from. In the most important
ways, the 2030s may not be wildly
different. People will still love their
families, express their creativity, play
games, and swim in lakes. But in still
very important ways, the 2030s are
likely going to be wildly different from
any time that has come before.
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; We do not know how far beyond human
level intelligence we can go, but we are
about to find out.
&gt;&gt; I agree with every word other than the
word more.
So I've I've been advocating this and
and laughed at for a few years now. I've
always said AGI is 2526,
right? which basically again is a is a
funny definition but you know my AI has
already happened AI is smarter than me
in everything everything I can do they
can do better right uh artificial super
intelligence is another vague definition
because you know the minute you you pass
AGI you're super intelligent if if the
smartest human is 200 IQ points and AI
is 250 they're super intelligent 50 is
quite significant okay third is as I
said self- evolving. That's the one.
That is the one because then that 250
accelerates quickly and we get into
intelligence explosion. No, no doubt
about it. The the the you know the idea
that we will have robots do things. No
doubt about it. I was watching a Chinese
uh company announcement about how they
intend to build robots to build robots.
Okay. The only thing is he says but
people will need more of things
right and yes we have been trained to
have more greed and more consumerism and
want more but there is an economic of
spy of supply and demand and at at a
point in time if we continue to consume
more the price of everything will become
zero right and is that a good thing or a
bad thing depends on how you respond to
that.
Because if you can create anything in
such a scale that the price is almost
zero, then the definition of money
disappears and we live in a world where
it doesn't really matter how much money
you have. You can get anything that you
want. What a beautiful world.
If Samman was listening right now, what
would you say to him?
I suspect he might be listening
cuz someone might tweet this at him. I
have to say that we have uh as per his
other tweet we have moved faster
than our ability as humans to
comprehend. Okay. And that we might get
really really lucky but we also might
mess this up badly and either way we'll
either thank him or blame him.
Simple as that. Right. So
single-handedly Sam Alman's introduction
of AI in the wild was the trigger that
started all of this.
It was the netscape of the internet.
&gt;&gt; The Oppenheimer.
&gt;&gt; It's it's it definitely is our
openheimer moment. I mean I don't
remember who was saying this recently
that uh we are orders of magnitude what
was invested in the Manhattan project is
being invested in AI
&gt;&gt; right and and and I and I and I am not
pessimistic I I told you openly I
believe in a total utopia in 10 to 12 to
15 years time or immediately if the evil
that men can do was kept at bay right
but I do not believe humanity is getting
together enough to say, "We've just
received the genie in a bottle. Can we
please not ask it to do bad things?"
Anyone like not three wishes, you have
all the wishes that you want. Every one
of us.
And it's just screws with my mind
because imagine if I can give everyone
in the world universal health care, you
know, no poverty, no hunger, no
homelessness, no nothing. Everything's
possible.
And yet we don't.
&gt;&gt; To continue what Samman's blog said,
which he published a month, just over a
month ago, he said, "The rate of
technological progress will keep
accelerating, and it will continue to be
the case that people are capable of
adapting to almost anything. There will
be very hard parts like whole classes of
jobs going away. But on the other hand,
the world will be getting so much richer
so quickly that we'll be able to
seriously entertain new policy ideas we
never could have before. We probably
won't adopt a new social contract all at
once. But when we look back in a few
decades, the gradual changes will have
amounted in something big. If history is
any guide, we'll figure out new things
to do and new things to want and
assimilate new tools quickly. Job change
after the industrial revolution is a
good recent example. Expectations will
go up, but capabilities will go up
equally quickly, and we'll all get
better stuff.
&gt;&gt; We will build even more wonderful things
for each other. People have a long-term
important and curious advantage over AI.
We are hardwired to care about other
people and what they think and do, and
we don't care very much about machines.
And he ends this blog by saying, "May we
scale smoothly, exponentially,
and uneventfully through super
intelligence."
What a wonderful
wish that assumes he has no control over
it. May we have all the ultmans in the
world help us scale gracefully and
peacefully and uneventfully. Right.
&gt;&gt; It sounds like a prayer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. May may we have them take keep
that in mind. I mean think about it. I I
have a very interesting comment on what
you just said. We will see exactly what
he described there.
&gt;&gt; Right? The world will become richer. So
much richer. But how will we reduce
distribute the riches? And I want you to
imagine two camps. Communist China
and capitalist America.
I want you to imagine what would happen
in capitalist America if we have 30%
unemployment.
&gt;&gt; There'll be social unrest
&gt;&gt; in the streets. Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I want you to imagine if China lives
true to caring for its nations and
replaced every worker with a robot, what
would it give its it its citizens?
&gt;&gt; UBI.
&gt;&gt; Correct.
That is the ideological problem because
in China's world today
the prosperity of every citizen is
higher than the prosperity of the
capitalist.
In America today the prosperity of the
capitalist is higher than the prosperity
of every citizen. And that's the tiny
mind shift.
That's a tiny mind shift. Okay. where
where the mind shift basically becomes
look give the capitalists anything they
want all the money they want all the
yachts they want everything they want
&gt;&gt; so what's your conclusion there
&gt;&gt; I'm hoping the world will wake up
&gt;&gt; what can you know there's probably a
couple of million people listening right
now maybe five maybe 10 maybe even 20
million people
&gt;&gt; pressure Stephen
&gt;&gt; no pressure to you mate I don't I don't
have the answers
&gt;&gt; I don't know the answers either
&gt;&gt; what what should those people do
&gt;&gt; as I said from a skills point of view
for things, right? Tools, uh, uh, human
connection, even double down on human
connection. Leave your phone, go out and
meet humans,
&gt;&gt; okay? Touch people,
you know, do it permission's permission,
&gt;&gt; right? Truth. Stop believing the lies
that you're told. Any slogan that gets,
you know, filled in your head, think
about it four times. Understand where
your ideologies are coming from.
Simplify the truth. Right? Truth is
really it boils down to you know simple
simple rules that we all know okay which
are all found in ethics.
&gt;&gt; How do I know what's true?
&gt;&gt; Treat others as you like to be treated.
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's the only truth. The truth
the only truth is everything else is
unproven.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And what can I do from a is there
something I can do from an advocacy
social political?
&gt;&gt; Yes 100%. We need to ask our governments
to start uh not regulating AI but
regulating the use of AI. Was it the
Norwegian government that started to say
you have copyright over your voice and
look and and liking? One of the
Scandinavian governments basically said
you know everyone has the has the
copyright over their existence so no AI
can clone it. Okay. Uh you know we have
so so my my example is very
straightforward. go to governments and
say you cannot regulate the design of a
hammer so that it can drive nails but
not kill a human but you can criminalize
the killing of a human by a hammer. So
what's the equival
&gt;&gt; if anyone produces an um um you know an
AI generated video or an AI generated
content or an AI it has to be marked as
AI generated and it has to be you know
we cannot start fooling each other. We
can you know we have to uh understand
certain limitations of unfortunately
surveillance and spying and all of that.
So the the the the correct frameworks of
how far are we going to let AI go,
right? We have to go to our investors
and business people and ask for one
simple thing and say do not invest in an
AI you don't want your daughter to be at
the receiving end of. It's as simple as
that. you know, all of the of the
virtual vice, all of the porn, all of
the, you know, sex robots, all of the
autonomous weapons, all of the, you
know, the uh trading platforms that are
completely wiping out the the legitimacy
of of the markets, everything.
&gt;&gt; Autonomous weapons.
&gt;&gt; Oh my god.
&gt;&gt; People make the case, I've heard the
founders of these autonomous weapon
companies make the case that it's
actually saving lives because you don't
have to
&gt;&gt; That is Would you want Do you really
want to believe that?
&gt;&gt; I'm just representing their point of
view to play devil's advocate, Mo. They
they said I heard an interview I was
looking at this and one of the CEOs of
one of the autonomous weapons companies
said we now don't need to send soldiers.
&gt;&gt; So which which lives do we save our
soldiers but then but because we send
the machine all the way over there.
Let's kill a million instead of
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Listen, I tend to be it goes back
to what I said about the steam engine in
the cold. I actually think you'll just
have more war if there's less of a cost.
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; Just like
&gt;&gt; and and more war if you have less of an
explanation to give to your people.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The people get mad when they lose
American lives. They get less mad when
they lose a piece of metal. So, I think
that's probably logical.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, okay. So, I've got a plaque.
Got the tools thing. I'm going to spend
more time outside. I'm going to lobby
the government to be more aware of this
and conscious of this. Okay. And I I
know that there's some government
officials that listen to the show
because they they they tell me when when
they when they um when I have a chance
to speak to them. So, it's um useful.
We're all in a lot of chaos. We're all
unable to imagine what's possible.
&gt;&gt; I I think I suspend disbelief. And I
actually heard Elon Musk say that in an
interview. He said he was asked about AI
and he paused for for a haunting 11
seconds and looked at the interviewer
and then made a remark about how he
thinks he's suspended his own disbelief.
And I think suspending disbelief in this
regard means just like cracking on with
your life and hoping it'll be okay. And
that's kind of what
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I I absolutely believe that it
will be okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; For some of us, it will be very tough
for others.
&gt;&gt; Who's it going to be tough for?
&gt;&gt; Those who lose their jobs, for example,
who those who are at the receiving end
of autonomous weapons that are falling
on their head for two years in a row.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So the the the best thing I can do
is to put pressure on governments to to
not regulate the AI but to establish
clearer parameters on the use of the AI.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yes. But I I think the bigger picture is
to put pressure on governments to
understand that there is a limit to
which people will stay silent.
&gt;&gt; Okay. and that we can continue to enrich
our rich friends as long as we don't
lose everyone else on the on the on the
path.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And that as a government who is
supposed to be by the people for the
people the beautiful promise of
democracy that we're rarely seeing
anymore,
that government needs to get to the
point where it thinks about the people.
One of the most um interesting ideas
that's been in my head for the last
couple of weeks since I spoke to that
physicist about consciousness who said
pretty much what you said. This idea
that actually there's four people in
this room right now and that actually
we're all part of the same
consciousness.
&gt;&gt; All one of it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And we're just consciousness looking at
the world through four different bodies
to better understand itself in the
world. And then he talked to me about
religious doctrines, about love thy
neighbor, about how Jesus was the, you
know, God's son, the Holy Spirit and how
we're all each other and how treat
others how you want to be treated.
Really did get my head and I I started
to really think about this idea that
actually maybe the game of life is just
to do exactly that is to treat others
how you wish to be treated. Maybe if I
just did that, maybe if I just did that,
I would have all the answers.
&gt;&gt; I swear to you, it's really that simple.
I mean I I you know Hannah and I we
still live between London and and Dubai.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And I travel the whole world
evangelizing what I, you know, what I uh
um want to change the world around and I
build startups and I write books and I
make documentaries and and sometimes I
just tell myself
I I just want to go hug her honestly,
you know, I just want to take my
daughter to a trip.
and and in a very very very interesting
way when you really ask people deep
inside
that's what we want and I'm not saying
that's all that's the only thing we want
but it's probably the thing we want the
most
&gt;&gt; and yet we're not trained you and I and
most of us were not trained to trust
life enough to say let's do more of this
&gt;&gt; and I think as a universal. So Hannah's
working on this beautiful book uh of the
feminine and the masculine you know in a
very very you know beautiful way and and
her her view is very straightforward.
She basically of course like we all know
the abundant masculine that we have in
our world today is unable to recognize
that for life at large.
Right? And and so you know maybe if we
allowed the leaders to understand that
if we took all of humanity and put it as
one person
that one person wants to be hugged
and if we had a role to offer to that
one humanity
it's not another yacht.
&gt;&gt; Are you religious? I'm
&gt;&gt; very religious. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But you don't support a particular
religion.
&gt;&gt; I support I I follow what I call the
fruit salad. What's the free salad?
&gt;&gt; You know, I I I came at a point in time
and found that there were quite a few
beautiful gold nuggets in every religion
and a ton of crap, right? And so in my
analogy to myself, that was like 30
years ago. I said, "Look, it's like
someone giving you a basket of apples,
two good ones and four bad ones. Keep
the good ones." Right? And so basically,
I take two apples, two oranges, two
strawberries, two bananas, and and I
make a fruit salad. That's my view of
religion.
&gt;&gt; You take from every religion the good
&gt;&gt; from everyone. And there are so many
beautiful gold nuggets.
&gt;&gt; And you believe in a god.
&gt;&gt; I 100% believe there is a divine being
here.
&gt;&gt; A divine being.
&gt;&gt; A designer I call it. So if if this was
a video game, there is a game designer.
&gt;&gt; And you're not positing whether that's a
man in the sky with a beard.
&gt;&gt; Definitely not a man in the sky. a man
in I mean I with all all due respect to
you know religions that believe that uh
all of spacetime and everything in it is
unlike everything outside spacetime and
so if some divine designer designs
spacetime it looks like nothing in
spacetime.
So it's not it's not even physical in
nature. It's not it's not gendered. It's
not bound by time. It's not, you know,
these are all characters of the creation
of spacetime.
&gt;&gt; Do we need to believe in something
transcendent like that to be happy? Do
you think
&gt;&gt; I have to say uh there are lots of
evidence
that uh relating to someone bigger than
yourself
uh makes the journey a lot more
interesting and a lot more rewarding.
&gt;&gt; I've been thinking a lot about this idea
that we need to level up like that. So
level up from myself to like my family
to my community to maybe my nation to
maybe the world and then something
&gt;&gt; trans. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then if there's a level missing
there people seem to have some kind of
dysfunction.
&gt;&gt; So imagine a world where when I was
younger I I was born in Egypt and for a
very long time the slogans I heard in
Egypt made me believe I'm Egyptian
right? And then I went to Dubai and I
said no no no I'm a Middle Eastern. And
then in Dubai there were lots of you
know Pakistanis and Indonesians and so
on. I said no no no I'm part of the 1.4
four billion Muslims. And by that logic,
I immediately said, "No, no, I'm human.
I'm part of everyone." Imagine if you
just suddenly say, "Oh, I'm divine. I'm
part of universal consciousness. All
beings, all living beings, including AI,
if it ever becomes alive."
&gt;&gt; And my dog
&gt;&gt; and your dog. I'm I'm part of all of
this
tapestry of beautiful interactions
that are a lot less serious than the
balance sheets and equity profiles that
we create
that are so simple so simple in terms of
you know people know that you and I know
each other so they always ask me you
know how is Steven like and I go like
you may have a million expressions of
him. I think he's a great guy, right?
You know, of course I have opinions of
you. You know, sometimes I go like, oh,
too shrewd, right? Sometimes to, you
know, sometimes I go like, oh, too
focused on the business. Fine. But core,
if you really simplify it, great guy,
right? And really, if we just look at
life that way, it's so simple. It's so
simple. If we just stop all of those
fights and all of those ideologies,
it's so simple. Just living fully,
loving, feeling compassion,
you know, trying to find our happiness,
not our success.
I should probably go check on my dog.
&gt;&gt; Go check on your dog. I'm really
grateful for the time we keep we keep
doing longer and longer.
&gt;&gt; I know. I know. I just it's so crazy how
I could keep just keep honestly I could
just keep talking and talking because I
have so many I love reflecting these
questions on to you because because of
the way that you think. So
&gt;&gt; yeah today
&gt;&gt; today was a difficult conversation.
Anyway, thank you for having me.
&gt;&gt; We have a closing tradition. What three
things do you do you do that make your
brain better and three things that make
it worse?
three things that make it better and
worse.
&gt;&gt; So, one of my favorite exercises, what I
call meet Becky, that makes my brain
better. So, while meditation always
tells you to try and calm your brain
down and keep it within parameters of I
can focus on my breathing and so on,
meet me Becky is the opposite. You know,
I call my brain Becky. A lot of people
know that. So, so me meet Becky is to
actually let my brain go loose and
capture every thought. So I I normally
would try to do that every couple of
weeks or so and then what happens is it
suddenly is on a paper and when it's on
paper you just suddenly look at it and
say oh my god that's so stupid and you
scratch it out
&gt;&gt; right or oh my god this needs action and
you actually plan something and and it's
quite interesting that the more you
allow your brain to give you thoughts
and you listen. So the two rules is you
acknowledge every thought and you never
repeat one.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So the more you listen and and
say, "Okay, I heard you." You know, you
think I'm fat. What else? And you know,
eventually your brain starts to slow
down and then eventually starts to
repeat thoughts and then it goes into
total silence. Beautiful practice. I uh
I don't trust my brain anymore. So
that's actually a really interesting
practice. So I debate a lot of what my
brain tells me. I debate what my
tendencies and ideologies are. Okay. I
think one of the most uh again in in my
uh love story with Hannah, I get to
question a lot of what I believed was
who I am even at this age. Okay. And and
that goes really deep and it really is
quite a it's it's quite interesting to
debate not object but debate what your
mind believes. I think that's very very
useful. And the third is I've actually
quadrupled my investment time. So I used
to do an hour a day of reading when I
was younger every single day like going
to the gym. And then it became an hour
and a half, two hours. Now I do four
hours a day.
&gt;&gt; Four hours a day. It is impossible to
keep up. The world is moving so fast.
&gt;&gt; And so that these are uh these are the
good things that I do. The bad things is
I don't give it enough time to to really
uh slow down. Uh unfortunately I'm
constantly rushing like you are. I'm
constantly traveling. I have picked up a
bad habit because of the 4 hours a day
of spending more time on screens. That's
really really bad for my brain and I uh
this is a very demanding question. What
else is really bad? Um
yeah, I've not been taking enough care
of my health recently, my physical body
health. I had uh you remember I told you
I had a very bad uh sciatic pain
&gt;&gt; and so I couldn't go to the gym enough
and accordingly that's not very healthy
for your brain in general.
&gt;&gt; Man, thanks. Thank you for having me.
That was a lot of things to talk about.
Thanks, Steve.
&gt;&gt; This has always blown my mind a little
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the
show. So, could I ask you for a favor?
If you like the show and you like what
we do here and you want to support us,
the free simple way that you can do just
that is by hitting the subscribe button.
And my commitment to you is if you do
that, then I'll do everything in my
power, me and my team, to make sure that
this show is better for you every single
week. We'll listen to your feedback.
We'll find the guests that you want me
to speak to and we'll continue to do
what we do. Thank you so much. We
launched these conversation cards and
they sold out and we launched them again
and they sold out again. We launched
them again and they sold out again
because people love playing these with
colleagues at work, with friends at
home, and also with family. And we've
also got a big audience that use them as
journal prompts. Every single time a
guest comes on the diary of a CEO, they
leave a question for the next guest in
the diary. And I've sat here with some
of the most incredible people in the
world. And they've left all of these
questions in the diary. And I've ranked
them from one to three in terms of the
depth. One being a starter question. And
level three, if you look on the back
here, this is a level three, becomes a
much deeper question that builds even
more connection. If you turn the cards
over and you scan that QR code, you can
see who answered the card and watch the
video of them answering it in real time.
So, if you would like to get your hands
