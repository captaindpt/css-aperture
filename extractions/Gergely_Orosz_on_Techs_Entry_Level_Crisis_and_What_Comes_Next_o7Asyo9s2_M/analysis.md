# Video Analysis: Gergely Orosz on Tech's Entry Level Crisis and What Comes Next

## Overview
This video features Gergely Orosz, author of "The Tech Resume Inside Out" and engineering leader, discussing the ongoing crisis in entry-level tech hiring, career growth strategies, and his concept of "energy" as the hidden force that makes or breaks engineering teams. The conversation covers the perfect storm of factors creating barriers for junior developers and practical advice for navigating the current market.

## Key Findings

### Theme 1: The Entry-Level Hiring Perfect Storm
A confluence of factors has created a 5-year crisis in junior developer hiring:

**Timeline of Crisis (2020-2025):**
1. **COVID Impact (2020-2021)**: Companies stopped hiring entry-level engineers due to remote work challenges
2. **Over-hiring Correction (2022-2023)**: Just as in-person hiring resumed, mass layoffs hit due to pandemic over-hiring
3. **AI Narrative (2023-present)**: Business leaders believe "AI = junior engineer" and are holding off on hiring

**Specific Company Examples:**
- Facebook canceled internship programs for 2 years (unprecedented)
- Consulting companies (Accenture, Cognizant) facing 30% revenue cuts as clients demand lower prices due to AI efficiency gains
- Only top-tier university graduates and those with strong connections getting hired

> "The job market has been brutal for entry-level engineers since around 2020, right as COVID started... just entry-level hiring for five straight years has been just really down."
> - Gergely Orosz (Result ID: 33, Score: 0.602)

### Theme 2: AI's Counterintuitive Impact on Developer Numbers
Historical pattern suggests AI will increase, not decrease, the number of programmers:

**Historical Precedent:**
- Every major programming advancement (assembly → high-level languages) increased total developer population
- New abstraction layers create new categories of developers rather than eliminating existing ones
- Business people will use AI to validate ideas, then hire engineers to scale successful projects

> "Don't forget that every time there was a step change in software engineering, it's true that the number of programmers increased."
> - Gergely Orosz (Result ID: 41, Score: 0.496)

**AI-Native Advantage:**
- GitHub CEO increasing entry-level hiring specifically for "AI-native" graduates
- Young developers comfortable with AI tools have competitive advantage
- Companies planning to modify interview processes to encourage AI tool usage

### Theme 3: Energy - The Hidden Force in Engineering Teams
Orosz introduces "energy" as an underexplored factor in team productivity:

**Energy vs. Process:**
- Teams with high energy accomplish goals regardless of process or tools
- Low-energy teams fail despite perfect processes and advanced tools
- OpenAI's rapid shipping attributed to "electricity in the air" - collective energy

**Energy Patterns:**
- High-energy cultures treat work like engaging video games (Factorio analogy)
- Companies eventually "run out" of energy (Google example vs. OpenAI takeover)
- Energy can be renewed but requires intentional cultivation

> "If you have energy of wanting to get something done you kind of just get it done... but if you don't have the energy and this is like a team which is kind of just low on energy there just doesn't matter what process you follow"
> - Gergely Orosz (Result ID: 55, Score: 0.431)

### Theme 4: New Success Metrics for Junior Developers
The bar for impressing employers has fundamentally shifted:

**Old Standard:** Build a to-do app in React
**New Standard:** Launch an app that generates revenue from strangers

**Practical Advice for Juniors:**
- Build and launch real applications using AI assistance
- Focus on generating actual revenue, even small amounts
- Demonstrate AI tool proficiency as native capability
- Consider graduate school to wait out the hiring freeze

> "So it used to be okay well if I made an app that might be impressive and now I think the thing that's impressive is like can you earn $1 from somebody that you don't know."
> - Gergely Orosz (Result ID: 0, Score: 0.494)

### Theme 5: Career Growth Strategy - Impact Over Activity
Clear framework for standing out and advancing:

**Step-by-Step Approach:**
1. **Master assigned work first** - be reliable and fast at core responsibilities
2. **Study top performers** - identify what makes them successful in your specific company context
3. **Focus on business impact** - understand and communicate the value you create
4. **Adapt to company culture** - success metrics vary dramatically between startups and big tech

**Common Mistakes:**
- Speaking at conferences without clear business benefit to team
- Focusing on activities that don't align with company goals
- Assuming what worked at one company will work at another

> "Figure out like what impactful is and and try to emulate it like at first and just be good at like getting stuff done reliably."
> - Gergely Orosz (Result ID: 43, Score: 0.347)

### Theme 6: Management vs. IC Career Paths
Nuanced view on the technical management decision:

**Key Insights:**
- Many senior/principal engineers become "jaded" after 20+ years because they wanted to try management but never got the opportunity
- Management skills valuable even if returning to IC role (hiring, cross-functional collaboration)
- Timing matters - opportunities don't come often
- Reversible at many companies (Uber's apprentice management program)

## Notable Quotes

> "Anybody who's a computer scientist should not be retiring right now should be working on AI. That's what I would just say."
> - Context about current technological moment

> "It's not about the tools, it's not about the process - it's about the energy. If you have a high energy culture... everyone is so full of energy"
> - On what makes teams like OpenAI successful

> "The places that hire the most junior engineers are actually very much under threat"
> - About consulting companies facing AI-driven revenue pressure

## Methodology
- Search queries used: "entry level crisis hiring junior developers", "AI impact programming jobs future", "career growth management energy teams"
- Expanded key results (IDs: 33, 41, 55) for comprehensive context analysis
- Focused on practical career advice, market dynamics, and team performance insights
- Similarity scores ranged from 0.3-0.6, indicating strong semantic relevance

## Conclusions

Gergely Orosz provides a sobering but ultimately optimistic analysis of the current tech landscape. The entry-level hiring crisis results from a perfect storm of remote work challenges, over-hiring corrections, and misguided AI narratives rather than fundamental industry decline.

His historical perspective on technology transitions suggests AI will create more programming jobs, not fewer, but the nature of these roles will evolve. The most successful junior developers will be those who embrace AI tools as native capabilities while demonstrating real-world value creation through launched products.

The "energy" framework offers a fresh lens for understanding team performance that goes beyond traditional process and tool discussions. This insight is particularly valuable for both individual contributors seeking high-performing teams and managers trying to understand what drives exceptional results.

For current and aspiring developers, the message is clear: focus on building real applications that generate value, embrace AI tools as force multipliers, and seek out high-energy environments where meaningful work feels like engaging gameplay rather than tedious labor.
