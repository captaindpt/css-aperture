00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.640
Today I’m speaking with Ken Rogoff, who&nbsp;
is a professor at Harvard, recent author&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.080
of Our Dollar, Your Problem, and&nbsp;
former Chief Economist at the IMF.&nbsp;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.720
Ken, thanks so much for coming on the podcast.
Thanks so much for having me and welcome to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.680
Harvard, which is where we’re filming this.
In your book you have a lot of anecdotes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.600
meeting different Chinese leaders, especially&nbsp;
when you were Chief Economist at the IMF. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.120
seems like you had positive experiences. They&nbsp;
would listen. You met the Premier with your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.040
family, and he would listen to your advice.
One, how does that inform your view about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.240
competent their leadership is? Two, how do you&nbsp;
think they got into this mess, with their big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.560
stimulus or whatever else you think went wrong?
To the extent that when you were talking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.080
them in the early 2000s, it seemed&nbsp;
like you were seeing eye to eye,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.760
or that they would understand your perspective.
Do you think something changed in the meantime?&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.160
First I want to be careful to say&nbsp;
that they listen to everybody.&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.760
The Chinese are way better than we are&nbsp;
at hearing a hundred different views.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.120
Mine would be one of many that they heard.
I was very impressed by the competence of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:14.160
Chinese leaders. I actually gave a lecture in the&nbsp;
Party’s training school where, if you’re a mayor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.040
a provincial governor, any bureaucrat on&nbsp;
your way up, you go to this thing which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.480
for them is like Harvard Business School.
They really looked for competence. Of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.960
there were various loyalty things. But when you&nbsp;
met the leaders—and I met a lot of them when I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.080
was at the school—they actually asked really raw&nbsp;
questions too. They said things I couldn’t believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.920
they were asking. And I was told that within&nbsp;
the school, you're allowed to say anything.&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.520
So they had that system for a long time. When&nbsp;
you met Chinese technocrats—or even the mayor of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.280
Shanghai—they were impressive. I'm not saying ours&nbsp;
aren't, but it's a mix. I think you know that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.760
I think Xi Jinping has really changed that. He’s&nbsp;
been the president since 2013, and over time he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.280
pushed out that system and moved more toward&nbsp;
loyalists, people who are less technocratic.&nbsp;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.320
Probably the most important talk I ever&nbsp;
gave in China was at what's called the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.960
China Development Forum in 2016.
It's this giant hall that had most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.160
of the top leaders in the party. A&nbsp;
lot of the elite of the tech world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.520
Mark Zuckerberg and many others were there.
I said, “Okay, I'm looking at your housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.560
I'm looking at your infrastructure.
It looks to me like you're going into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.240
a classical housing crisis problem.
Your catch-up is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.720
Your demographics don’t look good.”
I gave a list of things. “And by the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.720
it looks like power is becoming&nbsp;
very centralized in the economy.”&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.880
And I said, “I'm a Western economist. You're&nbsp;
doing an amazing job. What do I know? But I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.080
don’t think that would be good for growth.”
After I gave the talk—I just figured you only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.600
live once, you just have to say what you&nbsp;
have to say—a couple of top leaders came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.080
up to me and said, “Professor Rogoff,&nbsp;
we very much appreciated your remarks.”&nbsp;

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.720
I was thinking, “Oh no, they’re going to put&nbsp;
me in jail or something at the end of this.”&nbsp;

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:44.880
I’m less impressed by them now. And I’m worried.&nbsp;
Let’s say they get into a crisis—which I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:53.040
they’re in now. I think they're still in a&nbsp;
deep crisis—or somehow hotter heads prevail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.360
between the United States and China and we get&nbsp;
into some kind of entanglement nobody wants.&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.680
I worry that we’re not as competent. I’m speaking&nbsp;
about right now. We have some very good people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.440
but the average quality at the&nbsp;
very top, I think, has gone down.&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.800
And China’s not as competent either. That’s&nbsp;
a recipe for having bad things happen.&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.360
On that talk, you mentioned in the book&nbsp;
that, before, you had to clear your talk.&nbsp;

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.920
So you gave them a sort of watered-down&nbsp;
version of what you were going to say.&nbsp;

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.560
I have to say, it would take some gusto&nbsp;
to go up to the top party leaders.&nbsp;

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.400
Were you nervous while you were giving the&nbsp;
talk, saying, “Oh, it’s too centralized”?&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.240
I mean I was pretty experienced by that time.&nbsp;
I frankly never used notes, so the idea that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.920
was going to read my speech didn’t even occur&nbsp;
to me. Maybe it was a little bit spontaneous.&nbsp;

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.640
But I certainly felt at that moment,&nbsp;
what am I here for? What’s the point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.040
of coming to this? Why don’t I talk about&nbsp;
the elephant in the room? Everybody knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.800
this. I don’t know if everybody knew it, but&nbsp;
it was clear to me and I’m going to say it.&nbsp;

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.720
I think a lot of people in that&nbsp;
situation—even though they should or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.200
the logic makes sense—they often don’t.
Yeah, I’m a professor. So people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.680
had a big tech company or a finance&nbsp;
company, or all these other businesses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.240
most of them can’t afford to do that.
I think they know that when they invite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.560
a professor, they can’t cut your...&nbsp;
They can stop you from going again.&nbsp;

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.240
They invited me again, by the way.&nbsp;
Although the second time I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:40.320
talked to a tiny room instead of the big hall.
But, I give credit to the Chinese for listening.&nbsp;

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.160
You’ve said that the seeds of their current&nbsp;
crisis were sown in 2010 with their big stimulus.&nbsp;

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.280
Is it wrong then to blame Xi Jinping for&nbsp;
this? That was before his time. It was Hu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.800
Jintao’s government that launched the stimulus&nbsp;
that’s causing all these problems now.&nbsp;

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:05.760
Hu Jinato did it, but they kept it going. The&nbsp;
local government debt, that was an innovation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.520
put in with the 2010 stimulus. But they kind of&nbsp;
left it running and used it as a stimulus program.&nbsp;

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.960
Long tangent, but the local governments don’t&nbsp;
have enough ways to fund themselves. So they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.720
were allowed to sell land to start and fund&nbsp;
these construction companies, get revenue, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.960
sustain themselves. They let that keep going.
When Xi Jinping came in, I was told he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.080
going to be Ronald Reagan. I had very good&nbsp;
contacts in the intellectual sphere in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.880
Someone who had worked for me when I was&nbsp;
chief economist at the IMF, other people I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:52.960
knew whom I really trust. They're really smart and&nbsp;
well-connected, I don’t want to say their names.&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.800
But they were telling me, “He's going to&nbsp;
change everything. This is really the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:06.240
we’re going to liberalize our markets a bit.&nbsp;
We’re going to do the things we haven’t done.”&nbsp;

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.320
And he didn't do that much. If you&nbsp;
look at China’s growth, it actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.720
slowed down quite a bit when he came into power.
There are different ways to measure a country’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.800
output because China produces completely&nbsp;
different stuff than we do. They use their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:33.360
currency and we use ours. Nothing's perfect.
But one way to do it is this. What do they report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:41.440
their output to be in Chinese currency? What&nbsp;
do we report ours to be in dollars? Then we use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.840
the exchange rate to compare.
We can look at growth that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.760
way and if you do for China, it’s been&nbsp;
spectacular. It’s been very, very good.&nbsp;

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.160
It’s obvious they're pulling it out of thin air.
But there are these approaches trying to control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:08.160
for how you’d really compare how an ordinary&nbsp;
person lives or how an ordinary firm gets by.&nbsp;

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:16.000
When you look at those measures, China’s grown&nbsp;
is quite a bit less. If you go 1980 to 2012,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.800
the official growth rate is almost 10 percent.
This purchasing power parity rate—forgive me for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:29.280
using those words—is like just over 7 percent.
If you look in more recent years, it’s really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.440
slowed down a lot. Even the official numbers&nbsp;
have slowed down. I don’t know the number off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.440
the top of my head, but it’s 6% or 7% for&nbsp;
Xi Jinping, and maybe only 3.5%. They’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.440
starting from a very low base.
Okay, things were gonna slow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.920
down. It’s not all his fault.
But I think he’s been reluctant to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.440
take risks and I think it’s gotten us to where&nbsp;
we are. I think they’re in a lot of trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.320
They’re overbuilt in infrastructure. They’re&nbsp;
overbuilt in housing. Have you been to China?&nbsp;

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.120
I was there six months ago.
Where did you go?&nbsp;

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.760
Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing,&nbsp;
Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Emeishan.&nbsp;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:19.600
So you saw a few of the medium-sized cities.&nbsp;
At least one of them, I think, is the new tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.920
center. I can’t pronounce it.
Hangzhou?&nbsp;

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.680
Yeah it’s a big tech center. Some of the&nbsp;
smaller cities don't feel like the big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:35.680
cities. And 60% of Chinese income is from&nbsp;
what they call their tier-three cities.&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.200
I grew up in Rochester, that’s like a tier-three&nbsp;
city in the United States. But you could pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.800
Cincinnati, Liverpool. Rouen— I may&nbsp;
not be saying it right—in France is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.280
an example of a tier-three city.
And they have invested like crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:59.440
I’ve been to a few and I’ve studied the&nbsp;
data on it a lot. They have amazing roads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.840
amazing real estate, amazing housing.
But the feel of death in those cities...&nbsp;

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.560
They were very good at building stuff.&nbsp;
The Soviet Union was very good at building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.360
cement factories and steel plants and&nbsp;
railroads. But they’ve run their course.&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.840
They have other stuff: green&nbsp;
energy, AI, electric vehicles.&nbsp;

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.600
But believe it or not, that stuff’s still tiny&nbsp;
compared to infrastructure and real estate.&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.640
Real estate’s a third of the&nbsp;
economy by some measures.&nbsp;

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.520
So I think they’re in a lot of trouble&nbsp;
now in China. They let it go on too long.&nbsp;

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:43.040
But again, I wasn’t running things. If things&nbsp;
seem to be working and you try to change things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.320
you get thrown out. It’s not&nbsp;
easy to be in those shoes.&nbsp;

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.040
When I was in China, we visited a town of&nbsp;
half a million people outside of Chengdu,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.240
so one of these tier-three cities. Arriving&nbsp;
there, the train station is huge. Compounds are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.600
huge. Even when you’re driving around, like&nbsp;
a movie theater is this humongous complex.&nbsp;

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.840
I realized things were bigger in China. I&nbsp;
was used to that because I’d seen these other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.120
cities by that point. But I just thought,&nbsp;
I’ve seen cities of half a million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.720
I live in a city of half a million people&nbsp;
in San Francisco. This just doesn’t seem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.560
proportionate to the size of the population.
Then we visited a Buddhist temple that had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.520
been built recently as a tourist site. It was&nbsp;
ginormous. You would go through one little shrine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.080
and then behind it would be an even bigger&nbsp;
structure and then another one concentrically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.200
for like eight turns. It would take you&nbsp;
probably 10 minutes to drive through this thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.240
There was just nobody there. It was&nbsp;
like me and three other white people.&nbsp;

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.920
It’s very much that feeling. And the young&nbsp;
people don’t want to live there. I have a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.320
of young people here as students and I run into&nbsp;
people. They don’t want to live in these towns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.520
and the jobs aren’t there. I can’t&nbsp;
criticize them for trying that.&nbsp;

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.320
If you’d asked me in 2005, “Should we try to&nbsp;
encourage people to go out to the Rochesters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.520
and the Liverpools and the Rouens in France?”&nbsp;
I would have said yes. There’s too much in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.920
big cities. There’s overcrowding. Look&nbsp;
what happened to São Paulo. Look what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:20.880
happened to Mumbai. But I would’ve been&nbsp;
wrong. These forces are very powerful.&nbsp;

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:28.400
So a lot of their growth, and what they call&nbsp;
their GDP, is this stuff. So they’re having to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.960
reorient and people just aren’t that flexible.
It’s like when AI comes and puts everybody out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.480
of jobs. When construction jobs are gone,&nbsp;
and all these indirect things are gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.040
it’s not that easy to move everyone.
If it hadn’t been for financial repression,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:51.840
and all this investment had been done&nbsp;
through purely market mechanisms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.080
would things have turned out much better?
Even if China gets rid of all financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.960
repression today, they save a lot. So this&nbsp;
money has to go somewhere. Are there enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.440
productive opportunities to soak up all these&nbsp;
savings? Or could there have been in the past?&nbsp;

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.520
If they get rid of financial repression, is this&nbsp;
a problem solved, or could it have been solved?&nbsp;

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.000
What everyone’s told them forever is&nbsp;
their saving rate and investment rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:26.080
are astounding. It was higher before, but it’s&nbsp;
still maybe 45%, their consumption rate… ours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.600
is pushing 70%. European countries are a little&nbsp;
more temperate, but they’re in the low sixties.&nbsp;

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.080
Their consumption is very low. They have some&nbsp;
wealthy people that you saw when you went to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:46.320
the marquee cities. But a lot of China is&nbsp;
living on $200-a-month kind of incomes.&nbsp;

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.880
You could give them money. You could&nbsp;
let them consume instead of exporting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.680
it. They’ve been very reluctant to do that.
You could do things to encourage consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.800
Actually, even just changing their exchange rate&nbsp;
policy to allow it to appreciate more at times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.320
would make imports less expensive.
They have been very reluctant to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.960
do that. That’s what everyone tells them.&nbsp;
That’s certainly what I said in 2016 also.&nbsp;

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:23.120
The ticket to getting people to spend more is to&nbsp;
provide more security than they have. First of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.160
all, there’s nothing like our Social Security&nbsp;
system. You need to save for your old age.&nbsp;

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.560
There’s nothing like our health system. If you&nbsp;
work at one of the big state-owned factories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.000
they give you healthcare, but&nbsp;
otherwise you’re on your own.&nbsp;

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.800
They’re not allowed to invest abroad. It goes&nbsp;
in waves, but they’re not allowed to put their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:48.160
money abroad. So they’re trying to be careful&nbsp;
about all of that and not do things suddenly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.400
There’s nothing to do overnight.
But fundamentally, if you’re looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.880
at China and asking what’s wrong, it’s&nbsp;
that the consumer isn’t spending enough.&nbsp;

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:06.560
What’s happening right now is worse, because&nbsp;
housing prices are collapsing. That’s the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.440
thing they really let people save in. You could&nbsp;
either save in a bank account, which gets you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:18.640
a crummy interest rate, or in a house. Now&nbsp;
they’re going down, so people are cutting back.&nbsp;

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.480
They can dig their way out. There’s no&nbsp;
magic bullet to make them grow at 5%. By&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.560
the way, that is the official number but&nbsp;
I don’t think they’re anywhere near that.&nbsp;

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.720
There’s no simple thing, but&nbsp;
the general goal would be to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:40.160
try to rebalance investment, and consumption.
Going back to your point about whether purchasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.400
power parity is the right way to compare, or&nbsp;
whether nominal is the right way to compare.&nbsp;

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.080
I think in the book you say the nominal&nbsp;
comparison of GDP is better because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.080
you can’t buy Patriot missiles or oil&nbsp;
with purchasing power parity dollars.&nbsp;

00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.640
But if we’re trying to compare the strength&nbsp;
of the two countries—their relative strength,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.160
especially in a military context— if they can&nbsp;
build ships and munitions much more cheaply,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.520
and they have to pay their soldiers less,&nbsp;
isn’t that actually more relevant if we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.880
trying to figure out who would win in a war?
Shouldn’t we actually be looking at the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.560
that they have a bigger PPP economy than us&nbsp;
as a sign that they’re actually stronger?&nbsp;

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.880
Yeah. So in the book, I’m talking&nbsp;
about your geopolitical power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.560
where if you’re going to give money to somebody,&nbsp;
what’s it worth and how much can they use it.&nbsp;

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.120
But no, you’re absolutely right. They just&nbsp;
crush us in shipbuilding. It’s partly because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:38.640
they build commercial ships, and there’s a lot&nbsp;
of symbiosis between commercial and military.&nbsp;

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:44.720
I think they’re 50% of the global shipbuilding&nbsp;
market. For us to build a new aircraft carrier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:53.360
takes years and years and incredible expense.
One of the mistakes we’re making is trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.360
build everything ourselves. Let our&nbsp;
allies do some of this. The Koreans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.480
are really good at building ships. That’s&nbsp;
another place we could be importing from.&nbsp;

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:09.040
You’re right about the soldiers. They’re&nbsp;
paid much less. They have a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:15.120
advantages in a conflict against us.
We’re way ahead in your department,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:22.800
tech. That is our advantage at the moment. If&nbsp;
that were to dissipate, it would certainly hurt.&nbsp;

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.600
What is your projection? Right&nbsp;
now I think their nominal GDP&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:34.240
is 75% of America’s, or something like that.
Yeah, in dollars, what we call the market terms.&nbsp;

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.600
What’s your projection by&nbsp;
2030 and by 2040, the ratio?&nbsp;

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.080
I didn’t realize it was as high&nbsp;
as 75%. I thought it was a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:53.120
lower. I was actually going to say 75% in 2030.
At one point in 2024, it was around two-thirds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.600
but it’s really volatile with the exchange&nbsp;
rate. The dollar’s really high. When the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.560
dollar’s really high, it makes us look bigger.
I think they’ll gain about a percent a year on us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.400
maybe. I don’t think they’re going to&nbsp;
grow way faster than the United States.&nbsp;

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.000
Wait, that means you think they’ll never&nbsp;
actually have a bigger economy than us?&nbsp;

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.800
It’ll take a long time. We’re&nbsp;
talking about the absolute size.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.400
They have four times as many people.
There were these projections by Goldman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.480
Sachs and many others that we’d be like&nbsp;
Canada is to the United States pretty soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:36.720
Like all these extrapolations, they were&nbsp;
proven wrong. That brings me to a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:46.305
topic. A lot of people will look at some trend,&nbsp;
whether it’s growth in something, AI, China—&nbsp;

00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:50.320
I was about to say. That's a common trend in AI.
—and just project it into the future.&nbsp;

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.120
Economists at least consider ourselves terrible&nbsp;
at that. You go back and look at any of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.240
commissions that were supposed to figure out&nbsp;
what was going on. They happen periodically.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:08.160
Maybe Brookings puts one together, maybe&nbsp;
the government does. My former colleague,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.920
the late Dick Cooper, had a whole list&nbsp;
of these. So it is very hard to know.&nbsp;

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.280
But my gut instinct is that what’s happening to&nbsp;
China is what’s happened to Japan. It’s what’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:26.080
happened to Asia, what happened to the Soviet&nbsp;
Union. We have a more dynamic economy. We’re not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:32.320
perfect. Maybe we’re screwing it up right now&nbsp;
with all the tariff wars and deglobalization.&nbsp;

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:38.000
But we have this dynamism and creativity&nbsp;
that other places—at least other large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
economies—just can’t replicate.
They can build stuff. The French&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.120
have better high-speed trains than we do.&nbsp;
I hope you don’t ride on the train from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:54.160
Boston to New York. It’s nicer than it&nbsp;
could be, but it’s no high-speed train.&nbsp;

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.280
You mentioned China. Oh my gosh, their&nbsp;
high-speed trains are just incredible.&nbsp;

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.060
They’re good at that. But the really creative&nbsp;
stuff? I don’t want to say they don’t have any.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.600
There are some amazing Chinese companies. But&nbsp;
let me say that the US is really good at it.&nbsp;

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.840
We’ve kept that in our DNA. I think&nbsp;
it’s very important, to preserve it.&nbsp;

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:23.120
The 1% per year compression is actually an&nbsp;
extremely bearish forecast. Even people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:31.034
are pessimistic about China will say, “Oh, by 2040&nbsp;
they’ll be at 150 or 125% of US nominal GDP.” They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.034 --> 00:20:34.960
think it’ll be bigger, but only slightly bigger.&nbsp;
The fact that you think even by 2040 they won’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.320
have caught up is actually very extremely bearish.
No, I think they're digging their way out of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:44.480
crisis. Right now we know their prices&nbsp;
are falling. It's not because they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.840
inventing stuff really fast. We know that&nbsp;
interest rates are being pushed to zero.&nbsp;

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:58.080
All these are signs that demand has been&nbsp;
crushed and the economy's not doing well.&nbsp;

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:06.000
Historically, they have given numbers which are&nbsp;
accurate on average, as best as we can tell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.760
I think that's gotten less and&nbsp;
less true in the Xi Jinping era.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:10.640
Going back to the subject of your book. People&nbsp;
who are trying to predict when and how China might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.000
invade or blockade Taiwan will look at satellite&nbsp;
photos of different docks and see how many ships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.720
are there. They'll look at military preparedness.
From a monetary perspective, are there signs we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.800
could be looking for? For example, if they think&nbsp;
a lot of their American-dominated assets will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.640
sanctioned or they won’t have access to them,&nbsp;
could we see them liquidating those assets?&nbsp;

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.160
Would there be any sort of preparations that we&nbsp;
could see on the monetary side to let us know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.840
they’re preparing for something big?
I don’t think they’re going to do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:48.240
suddenly. But very crudely, on their reserves&nbsp;
they’re definitely moving more and more into gold.&nbsp;

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:53.120
It doesn’t necessarily help to move&nbsp;
into euros or Canadian dollars because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.160
those countries might side with us. But&nbsp;
they’re doing what they can to diversify.&nbsp;

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:05.600
I don’t think they’ve diversified into crypto yet.&nbsp;
I had a student do a paper on that. But who knows.&nbsp;

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.240
What they are doing very concretely is&nbsp;
not just about what they’re holding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.840
That’s the big fact everyone looks at.
They officially hold a trillion dollars in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.160
Treasury reserves. But the estimate a student of&nbsp;
mine did, in a nice paper—and I think others agree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.840
with it—is that it's more like $2 trillion.&nbsp;
They hold a lot indirectly through proxies.&nbsp;

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.440
The other part of it is that the whole financial&nbsp;
system runs through the United States. What we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:42.560
sometimes call the rails or the pipes of the&nbsp;
system. Your bank gets a purchase and my bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.120
gets that I’m going to get a credit. How does&nbsp;
that take place? How does it take place when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.040
we're in different countries?
The United States just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.240
disproportionately controls that.
That, they can’t live with.&nbsp;

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.640
They could live without their $2 trillion for a&nbsp;
little while. But they can’t live without being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.760
able to pay suppliers and other countries.
So they're working hard on developing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.200
their own payments mechanisms.
Russia actually did quite a bit in preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:20.400
for the invasion. We see China doing that.
Maybe they’re selling Treasury bills, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:30.640
don’t know exactly. I would advise that to them,&nbsp;
if I were a Chinese economist talking to them.&nbsp;

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:39.040
But I don’t think it’s going to be something&nbsp;
they’ll do suddenly. Maybe Trump will bring down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.840
the markets and then there’s nothing to save. But&nbsp;
they don’t want to be the ones to bring down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.120
markets and cause a global crash.
What would the alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.560
rails that they're trying to build look&nbsp;
like? Are they buying oil from Iran in RMB?&nbsp;

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.040
Will other countries they need things from&nbsp;
accept that? In 2030, what is their goal?&nbsp;

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.880
Absolutely. There are a lot of countries in&nbsp;
Africa and Latin America—some of them are almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:11.760
client states of China—that they can force.
Iran, of course, sells a lot of its oil to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.720
China even when there are sanctions.&nbsp;
They’re moving in that direction.&nbsp;

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:24.720
It’s not just about what you invoice the&nbsp;
payment in. It’s how we acknowledge it, how we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.720
clear our books. That’s what they’re working on.
It’s coming. The Europeans are working on it too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.840
by the way. Europe is not happy&nbsp;
with the situation. They're actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.960
forming a central bank digital currency. It’s&nbsp;
moving quite a bit faster than I thought it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.480
would. That’s actually one of the reasons&nbsp;
they’re doing it, for international payments.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.680
Let’s talk about Japan, which you also&nbsp;
cover in the book, or their crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:59.120
You blame US pressure in advance of that crisis on&nbsp;
the Japanese to raise the value of their currency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.800
and the actions by the Bank of Japan.
Zooming out, how much of the crisis is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.000
not caused by things like that, but just the fact&nbsp;
that high-tech manufacturing as a share of world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
output was becoming less important?
There are demographic factors as well.&nbsp;

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.480
So something like this was&nbsp;
bound to happen to Japan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.120
even if there wasn’t some&nbsp;
big crisis that preceded it?&nbsp;

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.840
South Korea’s GDP per capita isn’t that high&nbsp;
either, at least in comparison to the US.&nbsp;

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.360
How much of this is due to&nbsp;
actions taken by specific actors?&nbsp;

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.920
South Korea had a crisis in 1983 and another in&nbsp;
1997. They haven’t been crisis-free, by the way.&nbsp;

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.840
There are a lot of factors. The&nbsp;
demographics would be the most obvious one.&nbsp;

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.560
The rise of not just China but&nbsp;
Korea and other competitors too.&nbsp;

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.760
Japan invented a business model that a&nbsp;
lot of countries have since duplicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:57.920
The model was export-led growth.
Something people might not think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:04.000
about is it creates competition.
Most countries aren’t as big as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.720
United States, and there aren’t as many different&nbsp;
firms trying to do the same thing. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.320
we have trouble with competition here.
Famously, in Mexico at one time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:20.880
there were only two telephone companies,&nbsp;
two bread companies, two taco companies.&nbsp;

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.880
It’s very hard not to let monopolies&nbsp;
sit and use their political power.&nbsp;

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.760
So how do you get around that? Japan&nbsp;
did something that was really pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:38.320
innovative. Germany did it too to some extent.
In the export sector you’re competing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:46.520
the world, not just with domestic firms.&nbsp;
That created innovation and creativity.&nbsp;

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:52.080
Japan did really well with that.&nbsp;
But over time, others imitated it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.760
and started building the same things.
So that’s part of it. The aging is part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.080
of it. But I think the financial&nbsp;
crisis was a very big part of it.&nbsp;

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.320
What is the counterfactual? Suppose that the&nbsp;
crisis hadn’t happened, how much wealthier is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.880
Japan today than it might have been otherwise?
Oh, I think 50% wealthier per person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.640
way wealthier. That’s where they started.&nbsp;
It depends on which measure you use. But by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.800
market exchange rates they were richer&nbsp;
than the United States in the late 1980s.&nbsp;

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:29.120
Even if you use the more complicated&nbsp;
measures, they were richer than any European&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:35.040
country, richer than Germany, France, Italy.
They’ve moved to the bottom of the rung now.&nbsp;

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:47.280
The financial crisis wasn’t the only thing.&nbsp;
It’s a long story but we effectively forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:56.560
them to move faster to open up and deregulate than&nbsp;
they were culturally and politically ready to.&nbsp;

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.800
I give that as an example of something&nbsp;
in the book where I changed my mind.&nbsp;

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.720
I had looked at that for a long time&nbsp;
afterward. Going back to 2005—that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.880
long after the Japanese crisis—I would hear from&nbsp;
people like Jiang Zemin, who was the president&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.280
of China that I met, "We’re not going to&nbsp;
let this happen to us. There’s no way.”&nbsp;

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:23.520
We were discussing how I thought maybe they&nbsp;
shouldn’t have such a fixed exchange rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.080
He said, “That’s what the United States&nbsp;
told Japan. Look what happened to Japan.”&nbsp;

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.560
I didn’t push back that much with someone&nbsp;
like that. You talk to other people. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.560
I heard that from many people.
I used to think, how can that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:48.960
be? There’s this thing called the Plaza&nbsp;
Accord in September 1985 where we pushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:55.680
them to make their exchange rate more free.
But I used to say that you did that in 1985.&nbsp;

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.040
Carmen Reinhart, my co-author&nbsp;
on many things, and I date the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:11.760
crisis to 1992. That’s seven years later.
I continued to think that but over the years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.280
particularly recently, I’ve&nbsp;
started to think I was wrong.&nbsp;

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.280
These things unfold slowly.&nbsp;
Crises don’t happen overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.120
Japan deregulated and it worked. But&nbsp;
they didn’t know what they were doing.&nbsp;

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:32.320
I think it was a huge mistake for Japan to agree.
I actually heard from someone who attended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:39.040
the 10th anniversary of the&nbsp;
Plaza Accord, held in Tokyo.&nbsp;

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:53.120
The person who had been head of the Bank of&nbsp;
Japan in 1985 gave a speech to officials.&nbsp;

00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:00.560
He went like this and apologized, very&nbsp;
symbolically, “I have ruined our country.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:08.320
I did this. I take responsibility.”
He told that too when he read my book.&nbsp;

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:20.640
Financial repression is bad. But financial&nbsp;
liberalization needs to be done gradually.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.680
If you do it too quickly, you get a&nbsp;
crisis. Many crises are caused by that.&nbsp;

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:32.480
Asking as somebody who obviously doesn’t&nbsp;
know the details, at a high level how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.920
would you explain it to a novice?
How could a country be 50% less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.280
wealthy than it otherwise might have&nbsp;
been, simply from a financial crisis?&nbsp;

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.200
Whatever they could’ve otherwise produced,&nbsp;
why can they still not produce it?&nbsp;

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:55.120
A country’s producing a bunch of things. Why&nbsp;
are they producing 50% less just because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.520
a financial crisis a couple decades ago?
Their case is very unusual, although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:08.720
having a number like 10% or 20% is very typical.
In fact, one of my professors at MIT was teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.720
us about the Great Depression. He said, “Here’s&nbsp;
how to think about it. We were growing like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.680
then we get here and we go like this, and then&nbsp;
we’re going like this. We never got this back.”&nbsp;

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:30.000
There’s a lot of economic&nbsp;
models where, Solow catch-up…&nbsp;

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.560
Yes but what happened with a financial&nbsp;
crisis—particularly in Japan—is that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.680
sort of blew up their business model.
For example, maybe China wouldn’t have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.040
overtaken them so quickly if they’d been able to&nbsp;
borrow more freely, if their financial markets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:53.920
were working better, if they had been more&nbsp;
adroit. Their consumption collapsed. Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.520
didn’t quite know how to deal with that.
We in the US were much more brutal in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.240
what we allowed to happen than Japan,&nbsp;
but we got out of it pretty quickly.&nbsp;

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.320
I’m not sure we got back to where we&nbsp;
were, but we got out of it very quickly.&nbsp;

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:15.040
Japan has a very consensus-driven society. They&nbsp;
don’t want anyone to be in bad shape. Their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:22.560
struggle with this held them back for a long time.
Maybe 50% is too high and I should say 25% or 30%,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.360
but a lot better shape than they have been.
Just to put it into context, what do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.960
think the counterfactual wealth of&nbsp;
America looks like today without 2008?&nbsp;

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:41.040
Boy, that's a good question. I'm hesitant because&nbsp;
I probably have some paper giving a number for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.520
that and I might say the wrong thing.
We certainly cumulatively lost a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.480
It led to this political crisis&nbsp;
that caused us to lose a lot more.&nbsp;

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:01.840
I don't know, probably 15% lower.&nbsp;
It’s a lot lower than it would be.&nbsp;

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:08.000
We had this dynamic which we're living in right&nbsp;
now. It's still an echo of that financial crisis.&nbsp;

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.880
Now, mind you, you're asking about our&nbsp;
national income. Inequality matters and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:19.680
would we have done other things?
In some ways, the 2008–2009&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:25.680
crisis was a condemnation of the&nbsp;
system and people could see it.&nbsp;

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.400
Maybe it led to some healthy&nbsp;
cleansing. But I think it led&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.880
to a lot more damage than healthy cleansing.
I think this updates me toward the view that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.120
financial crises are even worse than I think.&nbsp;
It isn't just this bad thing that happens and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:47.600
you recover. If there's 15% lingering even&nbsp;
after almost 20 years, then wow that’s huge.&nbsp;

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:54.640
You’re losing a lot of cumulative growth. Look&nbsp;
at Greece today or Portugal. You kind of get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.400
back to where you're having a positive&nbsp;
growth rate, but you're not picking up…&nbsp;

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.360
They're very different from a normal&nbsp;
recession. Actually in a normal recession,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.040
you go down and then back up.
The United States had thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.200
it was immune to financial crises.&nbsp;
We really hadn't had one since 1933.&nbsp;

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.960
We had a different book that came&nbsp;
out in 2009. I mostly write papers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.120
but this was a book with Carmen Reinhart.&nbsp;
It was called This Time Is Different.&nbsp;

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.960
We had some papers published in advance.&nbsp;
We said: “No, they're different when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:33.440
have a financial crisis, it lasts way&nbsp;
longer. The slowdown is way worse.”&nbsp;

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.200
And we were mocked when we were saying that. I&nbsp;
think the New York Times had a two-page spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.800
saying how ridiculous everyone thought this was.
We could have been proven wrong and maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.560
if we’d done things better we&nbsp;
would have. But it is the norm.&nbsp;

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.320
There’s a few exceptions, like&nbsp;
Sweden got out in a year or two.&nbsp;

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.640
But normally they really are&nbsp;
different from a normal recession.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:37:10.640
You say in the book that you expect there to&nbsp;
be another spike in inflation within the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.080
decade and also that the fiscal position of&nbsp;
the United States doesn’t seem sustainable.&nbsp;

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.760
If you go forward 10 or 20 years,&nbsp;
when we do hit this, when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.720
piper comes calling, what actually happens?
Is it going to be some acute crisis, like what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.320
happened in Greece? Or are we going to have some&nbsp;
kind of Lost Decade like Japan? What will happen?&nbsp;

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:41.200
Typically, you have a crisis of some sort when&nbsp;
your debt is high and your political system is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:47.280
inflexible. We’ve checked those boxes.
Then you get hit by a shock you weren’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:53.600
ready for. You get caught on your back foot. It&nbsp;
depends on what the shock is, and how we react.&nbsp;

00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:03.600
The way Japan reacted was through what we call&nbsp;
financial repression, basically stuffing debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:11.680
into every insurance company, pension fund, bank.
The central bank holds almost 100% of GDP in debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.240
We think we have a lot—I don’t actually know&nbsp;
the number off the top of my head for the Fed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.240
but I want to say around $7 trillion.
Japan would have the equivalent of $30 trillion.&nbsp;

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:28.080
So they’ve done this. It’s not the only&nbsp;
reason they haven’t grown, not by any means,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:35.040
but it’s not good for growth. That’s one option.
I think for the United States, that’s tough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:41.520
We’re just a very market-driven system. If our&nbsp;
financial system had that kind of pressure put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:49.120
on it, it would be worse than when Japan did it.
And a lot of people lend to us. We can’t do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:56.480
to them. We can’t force French insurance companies&nbsp;
to hold US debt. We can only force U.S. ones.&nbsp;

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.760
So I think the most likely&nbsp;
thing will be inflation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:06.880
which only lets off steam. Because inflation&nbsp;
sort of pulls… well, it’s like a default.&nbsp;

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:13.120
And I’m not talking about hyperinflation. I’m&nbsp;
talking 10–20% inflation over a period. We just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:19.600
went through that. That actually knocked about 10%&nbsp;
of GDP off our debt. We might need more next time.&nbsp;

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.840
So it lets some steam off, but if you’re&nbsp;
still spending too much and you haven’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.640
fixed anything you’re back in the problem.
That’s what’s going on now. We had some steam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.600
let off, but it wasn’t enough.
I think when it happens again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:40.080
markets will be very unforgiving about it.&nbsp;
They’ll look at us and say, “You are not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:45.680
be trusted.” So it’ll raise the interest&nbsp;
rate more, our debt will build up faster.&nbsp;

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.640
I think at that point… There’s this saying&nbsp;
about Americans attributed to Winston Churchill:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:56.960
we always do the right thing after we try&nbsp;
everything else. I suspect we’ll try other things.&nbsp;

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.440
Just for the audience, there are four ways we&nbsp;
could get out of the debt: We could default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.960
which you don’t think is likely...
But really good for my book.&nbsp;

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.400
Already you timed this one so well. I’ll be&nbsp;
shorting the market when your next one comes out.&nbsp;

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:18.960
...Financial repression. I guess you could&nbsp;
actually cut the deficit. Or inflation.&nbsp;

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.920
You’re saying if there’s another&nbsp;
round of inflation, then after that...&nbsp;

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.920
What everyone calls austerity. By the way, this&nbsp;
word “austerity” that progressives use whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:36.320
you ignore debt building up and spend whatever&nbsp;
you want, “austerity” is when you don’t do that.&nbsp;

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:45.120
I think Ezra Klein’s book Abundance&nbsp;
actually makes the point that there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:51.120
costs and benefits to a lot of things.
This “austerity” language pretends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.280
there are no costs to having your&nbsp;
debt be higher and only benefits.&nbsp;

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:03.120
So yes, that’s what everyone else has to do.&nbsp;
We’ve gone longer than most without doing it.&nbsp;

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.320
If it's going to be a financial crisis&nbsp;
and financial crises are this bad…&nbsp;

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:12.480
Inflation crisis. A financial crisis&nbsp;
is the private sector, and the public&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.880
sector bails out the private sector.
So, the government, we’re not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:25.920
default. We're going to inflate, or do financial&nbsp;
repression, or baby steps austerity or something.&nbsp;

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:32.400
We're not going to have a crisis like Greece had.&nbsp;
That’s just wrong. But inflation's not pleasant.&nbsp;

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.520
Why wouldn’t we?
Because we can print money. We can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:44.000
honor our debts. We just never have to default.&nbsp;
Greece was using the euro and didn’t have control.&nbsp;

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.960
Japan was using its own&nbsp;
currency and it didn’t default.&nbsp;

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.560
They had a financial crisis, not a&nbsp;
debt crisis. They never defaulted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:57.280
on their government debt in that period.
I’m not sure if they ever did. I’m sorry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.800
they did in World War II. Of course, Japan&nbsp;
defaulted on its government debt in World&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:07.280
War II. That’s an interesting story.
But it was a financial crisis they had.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:14.320
Financial crisis is what’s making your banking&nbsp;
system not work, lending to innovators not work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.320
lending to dynamic companies not work.
Ben Bernanke wrote at the time a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.800
thought piece about this. He didn’t&nbsp;
really have numbers. He conjectured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:30.800
that was why the Great Depression was so bad.
When Milton Friedman, one of the great economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.120
of all time, looked at the Great Depression,&nbsp;
he said: “You didn’t print enough money. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:43.680
tightened the money supply too much."
And Ben came along 25 years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:49.200
He was a classmate of mine in graduate school.&nbsp;
I had the office next to him at Princeton.&nbsp;

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.200
He came along and wrote this amazing&nbsp;
paper. Again, it was just a thought piece,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:59.440
which is not a typical economics paper.
He said, “If it was just that you didn’t print&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.120
enough money, eventually wages and prices would&nbsp;
adjust. Yeah, maybe it wouldn’t happen in a year,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.920
maybe it wouldn’t happen in two years, but the&nbsp;
Depression took 10 years. How can that be?”&nbsp;

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:16.557
He made this conjecture. There’s been a lot of&nbsp;
subsequent work showing it. Again, there’s a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:16.557 --> 00:43:21.200
of debate about this, let me be careful.
But I certainly view the weight of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:27.600
evidence as saying financial crises are really&nbsp;
bad, which has led us to the situation in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:33.840
United States where we’ve gotten a little&nbsp;
happy-go-lucky about bailing everyone out.&nbsp;

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:39.280
I would describe Treasury and Federal&nbsp;
Reserve policy today as, “When in doubt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:45.040
bail it out.” Because they saw what happened.
But as your financial sector grows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:51.040
that will lead to a problem someday.
It did, of course, in the Silicon Valley Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:56.560
case. It continues to have echoes of that.
But I think an inflation crisis is more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.600
likely than a financial crisis, although&nbsp;
these things are very hard to predict.&nbsp;

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:07.520
You say in the book that we didn’t outgrow our&nbsp;
World War II debt. What happened instead was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:13.920
that financial repression after the war, and then&nbsp;
the inflation of the 1970s made our debt-to-GDP&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.280
ratio… It should have been 70-something,&nbsp;
but it ended up around 20-something instead.&nbsp;

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.080
Of course, we just had inflation recently.&nbsp;
Do you think there’s some irrationality in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.880
the market for US government debt already, given&nbsp;
that we can forecast what’s going to happen here?&nbsp;

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.400
They can read your book and see that&nbsp;
inflation’s going to go up. They can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.440
look through history at what’s happened.
Do you think there’s some irrationality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.280
in terms of what people are doing?
I think, number one, is that they have too much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:49.280
faith in the independence of the Federal Reserve.
The Fed’s been this amazing institution that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:56.320
evolved. It’s been the guardian of&nbsp;
low inflation. We can argue about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:02.560
if it’s the right inflation or not.
The Federal Reserve insists it’s very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:08.800
independent. The Supreme Court recently ruled that&nbsp;
Trump couldn’t fire Powell, the head of the Fed.&nbsp;

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.400
But I think they’re dreaming. There are so&nbsp;
many ways Congress and the President could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:21.600
override the Fed, especially if they declare some&nbsp;
kind of wartime or “war-on-pandemic” situation.&nbsp;

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.800
Though I wonder from the politician’s&nbsp;
perspective, maybe the independence of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.840
Fed gives them a convenient way to pass the buck&nbsp;
that they’re actually happy about. They can say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:38.480
“Ah, I’d love to do this irresponsible thing, but&nbsp;
I can’t because of the Fed. It’s out of my hands.”&nbsp;

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:45.200
That’s for sure. That’s why Trump bashes the Fed.&nbsp;
It’s not the only reason he does it. I think he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:50.240
actually disagrees with them. But he feels&nbsp;
that bashing the Fed, if there’s a recession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:55.360
which there might be, gives him someone&nbsp;
to blame for not lowering interest rates.&nbsp;

00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:02.560
It depends if we run into a world where interest&nbsp;
rates start creeping up… Right now, the 10-year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:12.560
rate is around 4.5%. That’s the nominal rate. The&nbsp;
inflation-indexed one is a little over 2%. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:20.320
30-year rate is around 5%. I think those are going&nbsp;
to drift up. And that makes mortgage rates go up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:27.440
student loans go up, car loans go up,&nbsp;
business loans go up. It’s painful.&nbsp;

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:32.640
The question is, at what point&nbsp;
does that pain become real?&nbsp;

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:40.000
As I mentioned, this would be catalyzed if&nbsp;
we’re hit by a shock, where you can somewhat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:49.360
take back independence temporarily from the Fed.
I think it’s easier to do than people think. Given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:56.160
that I think shocks are going to happen—maybe&nbsp;
AGI brings a shock we don’t yet imagine—people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.280
trust in Fed independence too much.
Now, I love Fed independence. I actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.400
wrote the first paper on why you should&nbsp;
have an independent central bank back when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:12.560
there were virtually no independent central&nbsp;
banks. I was a pawn at the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.920
I’m talking my own book when I say it’s a&nbsp;
great idea. I don’t mean my “book” book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:24.320
I mean my human capital.
I like to say that the Federal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:32.800
Reserve fights for its independence every day.
I hear senators say, “They’re idiots.” I hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:38.240
people in Silicon Valley say, “They’re idiots.&nbsp;
We should bring them under the Treasury.”&nbsp;

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.320
I used to hear that just from progressives.&nbsp;
But now I’ve heard that recently from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:47.920
some tech titans, that “Scott Bessent, the&nbsp;
Treasury Secretary, he’s smarter than Powell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.880
Why don’t we let him run things?” They could.
It does seem like the Fed works really well as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:58.880
it exists now. It’s independent. Sure, there are&nbsp;
people who criticize its actions as you say. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.360
on the whole, it seems like a reliable&nbsp;
institution that makes smart calls. They can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.600
be wrong, of course, but it seems so much more&nbsp;
competent than much of the rest of government.&nbsp;

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.680
If you wanted to replicate how&nbsp;
the Fed works—if you wanted other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.960
parts of government to work that way—is there&nbsp;
something we could do? Or is it more of a human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.760
capital problem than an independence problem?
Like, bankers and economists are really smart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.160
I don’t know if you could replicate&nbsp;
that in the Department of Education or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.320
the Department of Agriculture.
One of the things the Fed has is this simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.200
barometer that everybody sees. They don’t really&nbsp;
see it, but they have a feeling. They see gasoline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:42.720
prices, that's probably how they decide what&nbsp;
inflation is. But they have this simple barometer.&nbsp;

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.560
Mind you, particularly in recent years,&nbsp;
progressives have wanted the Fed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:54.720
solve inequality, social justice, and the&nbsp;
environment. But they have one barometer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.760
that they kind of control over the long run,&nbsp;
not in the short run but over the long run.&nbsp;

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.640
So that makes it a little easier to say,&nbsp;
“You wanted us to have low inflation.”&nbsp;

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:11.040
Whereas so many other things the government&nbsp;
does might be making everybody better off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.240
but they’re making some people more better&nbsp;
off. Maybe some people aren’t better off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:22.800
at all. It suddenly becomes very political.
Nobody elected the Fed, so it’s harder to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:29.440
make those decisions. I’m obviously a&nbsp;
technocrat, or I side with technocrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.600
My students are technocrats. I think&nbsp;
way more things should be like that.&nbsp;

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.240
But if you wanted to do that, suppose you get&nbsp;
called by the Pentagon tomorrow and they say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.120
“We want to run the Pentagon like the&nbsp;
Fed.” What do you tell them to do?&nbsp;

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:46.160
I was going to say, the Pentagon? I’m not speaking&nbsp;
about the current Pentagon, but just up till now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:53.120
I haven’t looked closely but it’s been run pretty&nbsp;
darn well. The military’s pretty efficient.&nbsp;

00:49:53.120 --> 00:50:00.320
There are people who tell me, “Okay, Elon&nbsp;
Musk can take a payload into space at 15%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:07.680
of—or maybe one-fifteenth of—what NASA&nbsp;
does. Why don’t we let Elon Musk run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:13.760
the Pentagon?” There may be something to that.
I think to some extent—and maybe I’m defending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:20.400
them too much—but you never know where the next&nbsp;
blow is going to come from. It always looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.280
a lot of your stuff is wasted, you built up. But&nbsp;
your enemy is looking at what you have. Where are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.240
you weak? Where are you strong? So I wouldn’t&nbsp;
have picked the Pentagon as the obvious thing.&nbsp;

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:36.400
But let’s say crypto regulation, that&nbsp;
would be a good example. Why don’t we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:44.720
have something more independent there? Instead,&nbsp;
as you well know, it’s been overrun by politics.&nbsp;

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:52.880
In fact, there’s this huge thing going on right&nbsp;
now. I don’t know how it’s going to play out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:59.840
The Fed has been protected, though not as&nbsp;
much as you’d think. But Trump got to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:06.800
Supreme Court and was told he can fire the&nbsp;
head of any agency. I assume, by inference,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:13.440
he can also fire anybody at any agency.
I think that’s a terrible mistake. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:20.800
need to have independent agencies. You have an&nbsp;
evaluation process. They answer to Congress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.160
If they go off in the wrong direction, you try to&nbsp;
fix it. But to just have everything switch every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.080
four years? That’s really very worrisome.
Before Trump—maybe for intrinsic reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.000
maybe because of norms—it was really hard&nbsp;
to fire people anyway. That didn’t produce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.920
remarkable competence across the government.
Let me try to consolidate some of the things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:46.400
you mentioned. Maybe it’s really important to&nbsp;
structure more of the government like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.000
If you're running a department, you&nbsp;
have just one target like the Fed’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.440
2% inflation target. That’s all you have&nbsp;
to do. Don’t worry about anything else.&nbsp;

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:59.120
I do think it’s impressive that the Fed has&nbsp;
avoided mission creep. It seems like every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.160
institution in the world falls into mission&nbsp;
creep—companies, government departments…&nbsp;

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.280
Oh, they haven’t avoided it. They’ve&nbsp;
been under incredible pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:13.520
Obviously, things have changed.
But I talk about this a bit in my book. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.640
go through the working papers and research coming&nbsp;
out of the various Federal Reserves and it's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:25.680
about inequality, the environment, social justice.
You’d be strained to find a paper about monetary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.200
policy during that period, because&nbsp;
they were under pressure. Part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:36.800
being independent is bending with the wind.
But they’ve managed to keep their core competency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.720
their core function of setting&nbsp;
monetary policy independent.&nbsp;

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:48.160
No, it’s been amazing. But it is a constant fight.
You can go to a country like Turkey. I don’t know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.240
what the inflation rate is today,&nbsp;
but it hovered up toward 100%.&nbsp;

00:52:52.240 --> 00:53:00.560
And Erdoğan—the president of Turkey—would fire the&nbsp;
head of the central bank every year. Every time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:05.760
they tried to raise interest rates, he’d fire&nbsp;
them. You can find other countries like that.&nbsp;

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.720
So we’ve been lucky. But you&nbsp;
can’t count on that continuing.&nbsp;

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:18.400
Apart from the political pressure problems&nbsp;
from the outside, you mentioned watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:24.080
your younger colleagues or younger economists&nbsp;
writing working papers at the Fed about these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:31.360
other issues like inequality or climate change.
From the inside, given what the younger people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:39.680
in this profession care about, do you expect&nbsp;
the competence or the focus to just decline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:46.320
by default, given the new generation?
No, this was a wake-up call. There was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:55.120
a blog that Hoover did. They looked at the&nbsp;
most-used words in our big annual meetings.&nbsp;

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:01.600
There’s this thing called the American Economic&nbsp;
Association meetings. Everybody goes. They took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:06.400
all the abstracts and titles from the&nbsp;
last 15 years and the word inflation had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.360
not appeared until this year.
But why are you optimistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:14.560
about when they get in charge...?
There’s an intellectual market. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:20.560
was a huge miss and there’s a market for figuring&nbsp;
it out. One of the good things about the American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:30.320
university system—at least in the sciences,&nbsp;
and I’ll speak for economics—is that things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:36.320
drift off but if something is way wrong—and&nbsp;
they were certainly way wrong about inflation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:42.480
I believe, and way wrong about interest&nbsp;
rates and debt—then there’s some rebalancing.&nbsp;

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:52.080
We have a very competitive system of publishing.&nbsp;
We have a seminar system that’s just ruthless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:58.000
There’s a debate around it. It’s not settled,&nbsp;
and maybe I’m wrong and they’re right but it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.680
definitely being debated now.
Whereas 10 years ago, I think I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:06.640
was like a lone voice in the wilderness&nbsp;
saying these things might happen again.&nbsp;

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:13.040
I would teach inflation to my students. They’d&nbsp;
sit there patiently. It was like I was teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:20.080
them the music of Fred Astaire or something.&nbsp;
They’d go, “Okay, it’s the 21st-century,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:25.920
the Internet, that can never happen.”
Or I’d teach debt. If I had foreign students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.720
they were all having problems. But the&nbsp;
American students were like, we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:38.720
just do whatever we want. But it’s changed.
Going back to the potential future problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.240
if we do go the financial repression route and&nbsp;
not the inflation route, how bad will that be?&nbsp;

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.160
As you were saying, after World War II we had&nbsp;
financial repression. But that was when we had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.720
the highest growth ever. On the other hand,&nbsp;
China and Japan, it seems like a lot of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.560
problems might be caused by the misallocation&nbsp;
of capital that financial repression created.&nbsp;

00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.240
Do you have some intuition about&nbsp;
how much we screw ourselves over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.920
with that route, as opposed to inflation?
We’ll start with World War II but it’s never just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.160
one thing, obviously. There were a lot of things.
So with World War II first of all, financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.440
repression was easy. The financial markets&nbsp;
had been destroyed by the Great Depression.&nbsp;

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.600
World War II became something of&nbsp;
a command-and-control economy.&nbsp;

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.440
There are a lot of interesting papers about World&nbsp;
War II that show that Americans just worked really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:30.320
enthusiastically. There was real patriotism in&nbsp;
the production. I’m not saying we’re not now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:36.960
but back then they were able to fill factory&nbsp;
jobs that we probably couldn’t even fill today.&nbsp;

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:45.200
As we emerged from World War II we had all the&nbsp;
soldiers come home. That’s a huge growth lift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.560
We didn’t manage it perfectly. We actually had&nbsp;
quite a bit of inflation during that period.&nbsp;

00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:01.200
The financial markets, as you grew up in and&nbsp;
as young people know them today, didn’t exist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:08.160
back then. The world has changed a lot.
Does that mean US growth would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.640
even higher after World War II if we had&nbsp;
just kept the government debt or figured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.440
out some other way to deal with it and&nbsp;
let financial markets develop earlier?&nbsp;

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:23.520
Maybe. We didn’t have any financial crises for a&nbsp;
long time because the markets were very repressed.&nbsp;

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:31.600
Oftentimes, when you get a financial crisis&nbsp;
it’s exactly when somebody comes along and says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:35.600
“I know, I can make us grow way&nbsp;
faster. Let’s just take away all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.440
the rules and regulations overnight.”
That happened in one country after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.360
another. It works, until you blow up.&nbsp;
So you’d have to say that, by and large,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:50.000
it was managed rather well. We&nbsp;
grew. The rest of the world grew.&nbsp;

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.320
It took time for private markets&nbsp;
to develop. One thing I should’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.720
emphasized was that our debt was very high&nbsp;
after World War II, about what it is now.&nbsp;

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:04.000
But there was nothing else. There wasn’t all this&nbsp;
private debt. That had all been defaulted on. I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:10.160
being slightly hyperbolic but maybe it was 50%&nbsp;
of GDP altogether. Everything else, state and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:16.160
local debt, had been defaulted on. Now, it’s&nbsp;
bigger than the federal debt by a wide margin.&nbsp;

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:21.600
So it was a very different world, putting in&nbsp;
financial repression back then, compared to now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.680
when that’s a big part of our business&nbsp;
models in the financial sector.&nbsp;

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.480
Just to make sure we’ve completed the&nbsp;
concrete scenarios, basically your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:38.800
prediction is that there’ll be some crisis, some&nbsp;
surge of inflation, then there’ll be austerity.&nbsp;

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:44.800
And then what happens? Is growth&nbsp;
really slow afterward because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.880
the government can’t spend as much? What do&nbsp;
the next few decades look like in your world?&nbsp;

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.840
I think it will be quite a wake-up call for&nbsp;
Americans, having to adjust under difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:02.480
circumstances. Most likely, we get hit by a&nbsp;
shock. We want to borrow a lot. The bonds are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:07.680
rising faster than they did the other times&nbsp;
we did. And we're not able to do as much.&nbsp;

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:13.680
It’s not the end of the world. During the&nbsp;
European debt crisis from 2010 to 2012,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:19.680
most European countries raised their retirement&nbsp;
ages. They didn’t do it right away. They did it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:27.440
10 or 15 years out. There’s stuff you can do.
So I want to be careful here and say it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.640
not like the end of the world,&nbsp;
but it’ll be pretty unpleasant.&nbsp;

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:37.520
This will affect the entire world, since&nbsp;
the global system is very dollar-centric.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:43.520
It won’t be good for our franchise,&nbsp;
the dollar being so used everywhere.&nbsp;

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.200
As other countries start using the dollar less,&nbsp;
our interest rates will climb even higher.&nbsp;

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:59.600
I’m an academic. I’m not trying to push my ideas&nbsp;
by being maximally hysterical. But hysterical is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:06.640
definitely within the realm of possibility here.
What I’m saying is more likely than not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.720
not that it’s not definitely going to happen. We&nbsp;
could have growth. We could have a whole lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:19.680
high-skill immigration. We could make changes.&nbsp;
There are a lot of things that could go well.&nbsp;

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:25.760
On the growth thing, Europe’s growth has been&nbsp;
pretty bad after 2010. Japan obviously has had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.480
pretty bad growth after their crisis. Why will&nbsp;
we be in a different position if we do have this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:37.920
kind of crisis? Why will growth continue apace?
No, it’s going to cause a pause in growth. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:43.200
main reason debt crises happen is we don’t&nbsp;
have an automated system of working it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:50.400
When the stock market crashes it’s painful,&nbsp;
you’re looking around for who got hurt.&nbsp;

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.720
But when you have debt crashes, we take five&nbsp;
years, ten years, to figure out who owes what.&nbsp;

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.800
It’s that process of allocating&nbsp;
the losses that causes problems.&nbsp;

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.280
That, by the way, is why so many&nbsp;
people thought, “China’s fine. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:13.680
president will just tell everyone what it is.”
That turns out to be not as true as they thought.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:26.400
Is it possible to believe both that AGI is near&nbsp;
and that America’s fiscal position is untenable?&nbsp;

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.360
What do you mean by saying AGI is coming?
Any job that can be done purely through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.960
computers is automated. So white-collar work, the&nbsp;
work we do even, is automated within 20 years.&nbsp;

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.520
Anytime you get a big productivity boost, it’s&nbsp;
fantastic. If it comes quickly, yes that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:50.880
solve problems. I will say that historically,&nbsp;
there have been lots of times when countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:57.040
had good growth—even higher than their interest&nbsp;
rates—and they still got into trouble because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:03.520
fiscal policy isn’t mechanical. It’s political.
It’s about how much you spend, who wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:12.080
what. It’s not an arithmetic question.
Let me say it another way. Nobody ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.040
defaulted or had high inflation because&nbsp;
of arithmetic, because they couldn’t pay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.280
or couldn’t have called in someone who knew what&nbsp;
to do. They do it because of political pressures.&nbsp;

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.240
I think if AGI came that fast and&nbsp;
that big, it would make the populism&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:36.640
phenomenon we’re facing now seem like nothing.
If AI is going to be massively deflationary—if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.800
it makes all these goods so much cheaper—should&nbsp;
we be printing a bunch of money to still stick to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.240
2% inflation? Or does that not matter anymore?
Well, we certainly can run monetary policy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.680
same way. You don’t automatically get deflation&nbsp;
just because some goods are going down.&nbsp;

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.960
You can do things to increase demand so that there&nbsp;
are upward pressures on final prices. Even if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:07.840
AI workers aren’t demanding anything, you can put&nbsp;
in a lot of demand so firms charge a lot, not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:14.320
for the services that AI is replacing but also&nbsp;
for the raw minerals and materials that go in.&nbsp;

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.320
Fundamentally, when you have productivity, it&nbsp;
makes it easier for the monetary authorities—the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.760
Federal Reserve—to deliver low inflation&nbsp;
and good growth. That’s what they’re trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:34.640
to do. It makes their job easier. And I think it&nbsp;
takes the pressure off them—somewhat—to inflate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:39.280
because things are going pretty well.&nbsp;
So there aren't the same pressures.&nbsp;

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.800
But should they be trying to fight&nbsp;
the deflation at all, in that world?&nbsp;

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.000
Because traditionally we need inflation to&nbsp;
root out the rentiers and to fight downward&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.600
wage rigidity. But now the AIs have all the&nbsp;
jobs, so we don’t need to worry about that.&nbsp;

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.880
There are a bunch of biases humans have&nbsp;
that we need inflation to correct for. Do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.840
we even need that in a world with AI?
Okay, that is a very good point. Frankly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:07.680
Keynes founded modern macroeconomics.&nbsp;
He was an incredible Renaissance person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.280
having both sides of the brain.
One of his insights that just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.880
transformed things was this.
Before Keynes, we used what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:23.600
we now call general equilibrium models: demand and&nbsp;
supply, prices moving to keep everything in line.&nbsp;

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:29.920
But Keynes was looking at the Great Depression&nbsp;
and said, “Prices should be coming down. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.240
they’re not. Why aren't they?”
That’s really a cornerstone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.200
At the end of the day, it’s mostly&nbsp;
human behavior. It’s mostly workers.&nbsp;

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:44.880
So if you have these docile AI workers—they’re&nbsp;
not workers, they’re just firms—and if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.720
firms that are willing to let prices fall, then&nbsp;
certainly you can do that. I mean, we’re still&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:58.240
going to have some human workers? I don't know.
But here’s a question on what monetary policy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.640
should be. Do you think interest rates&nbsp;
are going to go up or down? When we had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.440
deflation last time—from demand-deflation,&nbsp;
like after the financial crisis and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.640
pandemic—interest rates went down.
My intuition here is that interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:19.680
rates would need to go up. I mean real interest&nbsp;
rates, real inflation-adjusted interest rates.&nbsp;

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.200
And then, deflation isn’t such a problem. You&nbsp;
just don’t let the interest rates go up as much.&nbsp;

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:34.000
Last time, interest rates went to basically&nbsp;
zero. That’s a whole other line of discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
They felt they couldn’t lower them&nbsp;
into significantly negative territory.&nbsp;

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.960
So they were sort of paralyzed. There was&nbsp;
this deflation, or at least too-low inflation.&nbsp;

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.480
Monetary authorities thought they&nbsp;
knew how to create inflation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:52.800
but that’s always been by cutting interest&nbsp;
rates lower. When they hit a bottom, they don’t.&nbsp;

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:58.480
I have a whole book about negative interest&nbsp;
rates and that’s a whole other thing.&nbsp;

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:05.280
If we’re imagining real interest rates&nbsp;
going up, then it’s not much of a technical&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.600
problem. You just let the interest rates rise&nbsp;
a little less so you’re not getting deflation.&nbsp;

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.440
Do you expect interest rates to go up? Because one&nbsp;
factor is that you want to invest in the future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.320
the future has so much more potential. Another&nbsp;
is that maybe you want to consume more now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.520
because you know you’re going to be wealthier&nbsp;
in the future anyway. You might as well start&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.640
spending as much as you can now.
I think AGI and AI are upward&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:36.640
pressures on interest rates for lots of&nbsp;
crude reasons. The huge energy needs.&nbsp;

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.680
Traditionally, when you did a lot&nbsp;
of investment it raised wages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.320
but it’s possible— there are economists like&nbsp;
Daron Acemoglu who’ve shown it can go both ways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:04.160
it’s not difficult to show that—if you're really&nbsp;
just substituting for workers, it’s making capital&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:11.040
more valuable, you just invest even more.
The pressures on monetary policy will depend a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:20.560
little bit on that. In principle, it makes life&nbsp;
easier. If it did push the interest rate down to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.720
zero, there are interesting questions&nbsp;
around that, but maybe your audience&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.560
might not be as fascinated by them as I am.
Let’s talk about it a little bit. If we expect&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.840
interest rates to go up because of AI, what&nbsp;
should the government be doing right now to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.360
be ready for that? Should they be locking in&nbsp;
hundred-year bonds at the current interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:47.840
rates since they’re only going up from here?
I’m going to get to that. But first, just where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.840
we are… I follow interest rates today&nbsp;
all the time. Maybe a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.280
who listen to you don’t. But let’s talk&nbsp;
about inflation-adjusted interest rates.&nbsp;

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.760
There’s a 10-year bond that’s indexed to&nbsp;
the inflation rate, issued by our Treasury.&nbsp;

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:10.480
Inflation-indexed debt is only about 10% of our&nbsp;
total debt. There are tax considerations—it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.520
not perfect—but it’s a pretty good measure&nbsp;
of what we call the real interest rate.&nbsp;

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:23.920
It had gone to minus one at one point after the&nbsp;
pandemic. It averaged zero for about 10 years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:34.160
from 2012 to 2021. And it’s higher now.
That is, for a macroeconomist, the biggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:41.760
question in the world. Because it affects asset&nbsp;
prices, it affects risk, it affects volatility.&nbsp;

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.040
I regard it as just a normalization.&nbsp;
I think it was likely to happen.&nbsp;

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.040
If you go around and talk to some of my&nbsp;
younger colleagues, or folks at other places,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:58.800
there’s quite a debate about that. A&nbsp;
lot of people think, “We’re getting old,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.960
we’re not inventing anything...” I know you’ve&nbsp;
just been arguing against that and good for you.&nbsp;

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.840
I tend to think interest rates are more likely to&nbsp;
go up than down, going forward. I’m talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.960
these long-term interest rates—the Federal&nbsp;
Reserve just sets the overnight interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:22.000
rate—these long-term interest rates are set by&nbsp;
markets, and I think they’re more likely to go up.&nbsp;

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.160
But I think AGI is only a piece of it. Debt is&nbsp;
rising everywhere. There’s the remilitarization&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.080
of much of the world. Needing to deal with climate&nbsp;
change. Eventually if we’re not dealing with it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:43.440
then we’re dealing with climate disasters.
There’s growing populism, geopolitical&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.240
fracturing, many things.
I tend to think interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:53.200
rates are going to go up but not just for the&nbsp;
good reason that we’ve gotten more creative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.360
and that everything’s going to be better.
You've said in the book that you expect a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:04.880
rebalancing from US equities to foreign&nbsp;
equities. US equities have outpaced&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.880
foreign stocks for the last couple of decades.
You say you expect this to change or that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.600
will be some rebalancing. What causes that?
What I say very concretely is that when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.880
dollar is really high, you should expect the&nbsp;
euro to go up. I feel strongly about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:29.440
My first important paper was about exchange&nbsp;
rates. That’s why the book’s about exchange rates.&nbsp;

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.560
When Japan’s really weak or when the dollar’s&nbsp;
really strong—it’s very hard to predict exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.360
rates—but I think the euro will do well.
There’s a lot of room to catch-up in Europe.&nbsp;

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.160
I actually think I’m nuanced in what I say&nbsp;
in the book. Trump hadn’t been elected yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.200
but I say Europe seems to be&nbsp;
under pressure to re-militarize.&nbsp;

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.120
I was aware that Harris was probably&nbsp;
going to cut the US defense budget,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.760
so that would put pressure on them.
Re-militarizing would actually be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:09.760
good for the euro. It would be good&nbsp;
for technology in Europe. It would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:18.640
give them more geopolitical power in the system.
Now, just so your listeners can calibrate this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.880
my first book was a very mathematical one,&nbsp;
Foundations of International Macroeconomics.&nbsp;

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.320
In theory, you should diversify. You shouldn’t&nbsp;
put all your money in the United States. I did a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.240
video with Zbigniew Brzezinski, Mika&nbsp;
Brzezinski’s father. For those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:47.440
don’t know, he was Carter’s Kissinger.
I did a video with him that Merrill Lynch&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:53.600
produced. It was about why international&nbsp;
diversification could be good. What they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:53.600 --> 01:13:00.720
got me to say was very, very limited.&nbsp;
I feel quite fine about what I said.&nbsp;

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.600
I wasn’t doing any consulting at the time,&nbsp;
just academic work. I didn’t do speeches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.160
I didn’t do consulting. I talked to&nbsp;
central banks a bit, but I didn’t do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:17.840
anything for money. But I did get paid for that.
It circulated half a million copies of it. A lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:25.440
of my friends teased me and said I would’ve made a&nbsp;
lot more money if I hadn’t followed my own advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:37.440
I can think of plenty of other examples like that.
But yes, my instinct is that—this idea that our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.040
US premium should just keep getting&nbsp;
bigger and bigger—these things have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.280
some regression to the mean. Maybe not&nbsp;
with AI all being in the US, I don’t know.&nbsp;

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.200
Is it that you’re predicting&nbsp;
that the S&amp;P keeps growing at 8%,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.440
but foreign equities do even better?
I’m just going to safely say foreign&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.680
equities do better than dollar equities.
But not because the growth in US equities&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.440
slows down, it’s just that&nbsp;
foreign equities do even better?&nbsp;

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:08.400
Look, you have a lot of friends who spend all&nbsp;
their time doing this. I wouldn’t pretend to.&nbsp;

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:16.560
I hold a very neutral portfolio because I talk to&nbsp;
policymakers and world leaders even on occasion.&nbsp;

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:23.200
I don’t want to be someone who’s talking about&nbsp;
regulating Bitcoin and owning a lot of Bitcoin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.760
to pick a random example.
So I wouldn’t regard myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.240
as great at this. But yes, I think there’s&nbsp;
a case for international diversification,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.840
particularly into Europe at this point&nbsp;
because they have so much potential catch-up.&nbsp;

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:47.120
Just as in California, where you’re from, there’s&nbsp;
a little bit of dim awareness that it might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.720
overregulated and you might want to do things&nbsp;
differently, I feel that’s happening in Europe.&nbsp;

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.880
If you look internationally, if you'd been&nbsp;
betting on catch-up, I wonder how you’d&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.520
backtest it. There’s some intuition there that if&nbsp;
you’re poor and you’re further from the frontier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.800
it makes sense that it would be easier for you to&nbsp;
catch up. But there’s another intuition that if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.960
you’ve been persistently behind the frontier,&nbsp;
there must be some deep endogenous reason.&nbsp;

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:18.960
You’re absolutely right. For example, Asia has&nbsp;
a lot more governance problems on the whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.800
There’s a reason that their price-earnings&nbsp;
ratios are lower, because you don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:30.640
trust the governance. You’re right.
That’s fair and a lot of people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:41.520
just betting on that. But I don’t think Europe&nbsp;
is so hopeless that it can’t pull it together.&nbsp;

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:47.840
I can make a comparison. I'm a basketball fan.&nbsp;
The Boston Celtics just got crushed by the Knicks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.000
just before we’re taping this. Part of&nbsp;
it is because our star, Jayson Tatum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.360
was injured. You may not have gotten any&nbsp;
better, Europe in this case, but if somebody’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.520
hobbling the United States—I do think that’s&nbsp;
going on to some extent now—you do better.&nbsp;

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.880
Is there some institutional reform we&nbsp;
could make that would get us out of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.680
political equilibrium we're stuck in.
Both parties, when they're in power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:26.880
are incentivized to increase the debt and there's&nbsp;
no institutional check on that proclivity.&nbsp;

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.720
There have been a lot of people who’ve tried&nbsp;
this, for example by having what are called&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:40.640
fiscal councils. I did a paper once with&nbsp;
Julia Pollak, who’s a brilliant economist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:50.000
when she was an undergraduate. That was quite a&nbsp;
while ago. A number of countries experimented with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.720
fiscal councils, but it hasn't worked.
The country that's done the most with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.840
this is probably the United Kingdom. George&nbsp;
Osborne, when he was Chancellor, set up this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:08.720
fiscal authority. The big thing they did&nbsp;
is they made predictions so the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:13.920
doesn’t get to make up different predictions.
You don’t necessarily have to go by their numbers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.280
but they got to say whatever they thought.
Our CBO does not get to do that quite the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.200
same. Our Congressional Budget&nbsp;
Office is very good, but they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.720
constrained to believe what Congress tells them.
If Congress says, “We’re putting in this tax hook,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.320
but it’s going to go away after ten years,”&nbsp;
or “We’re doing this policy, it’s all going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:39.360
to change,” then they’re forced to use those&nbsp;
parameters. The UK version is more independent.&nbsp;

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:47.280
There are lots of complaints about it, but that’s&nbsp;
a very poor man’s fiscal authority, just somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:53.520
who says, “This is what your deficit looks like.”
It’s the same thing as our CBO, but with more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:00.640
independence. It helps. But I think it&nbsp;
has to go to our electoral system, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:08.480
Our campaign financing. Do we have term limits?
You think that would help? I think, if anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.920
if you’re longer in office, you might have a more&nbsp;
long-term incentive. To the extent that a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:18.960
the deficit problems are caused by populism, I&nbsp;
don’t know how much campaign finance would help.&nbsp;

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.200
Maybe you’re right. I don’t have&nbsp;
a magical solution to this. It’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:33.440
all over the world. Nobody's finding&nbsp;
a particularly great solution to it.&nbsp;

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.280
The only encouraging thing is that&nbsp;
these things go in waves. So maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.080
this one will end. But we’re certainly in&nbsp;
a really difficult situation right now.&nbsp;

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:49.920
Somebody asked me, “If you were advising a&nbsp;
Republican president or something, what would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.960
you do? What problem would you face?” The biggest&nbsp;
problem is that in a few years there’s going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.480
be a Democratic president. They’re going to do&nbsp;
exactly the opposite of what you wanted to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:03.760
It’s the same thing for the Democratic presidents.
How do you have some continuity? How do you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:10.720
policies put in place that the public can rely on?
We’ve done well in the United States in some ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.120
because our government’s been kind of weak and&nbsp;
hasn’t been doing stuff. The private sector can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.960
work around it. I’m not saying it’s perfect.&nbsp;
There are lots of things we should do. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:29.840
look, this is out of my paycheck, so to speak.
You're the former Chief Economist of the IMF!&nbsp;

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:37.840
All right, but that’s economics.&nbsp;
These are very political questions.&nbsp;

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:47.280
Brexit’s an example of democracy gone amok.&nbsp;
What a dumb idea. I don’t know if Brexit was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.920
right or wrong. I feel like we’ll know in 50&nbsp;
years. But you shouldn’t be able to do it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:57.680
a simple majority vote. You should need a&nbsp;
two-thirds vote, or something like that.&nbsp;

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:05.280
There’s a whole government department here&nbsp;
with people specializing in what we should do.&nbsp;

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.960
Actually, I think there are&nbsp;
experiments. Washington State&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.160
experimented with different voting choices.&nbsp;
Maine did. There are these ideas out there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:21.040
but we’re a long way from converging on anything.
If you think people are underweighting how big&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.600
the debt issue is, are you especially&nbsp;
long on countries which have a low&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:31.840
debt-to-GDP ratio, like Australia or Norway?
It's not the only thing going on in the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:40.560
your debt is just one thing. Countries&nbsp;
like Australia and Canada for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:46.160
are what we call commodity exporters.
They know that sometimes the sun shines&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:52.240
and sometimes it's a dark winter.
They don’t quite sell oil but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:58.400
sell some coal, natural gas, and some oil.
They understand things move around and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:04.720
they need to save for a rainy day.
Norway is in a whole other league.&nbsp;

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.840
But yes, there are lots of factors to&nbsp;
whether a country will do well. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:20.000
lower-debt countries have less of a problem.
But Canada and Australia face very volatile&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
income streams because of commodities, so&nbsp;
they tend to be more nervous about debt.&nbsp;

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.720
By the way, they also have a lot of housing debt,&nbsp;
in Canada for example that's been a big problem.&nbsp;

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:37.040
But I’m bullish on the United States.&nbsp;
Don’t misunderstand me. I’m not saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.960
everyone should leave the United States&nbsp;
and go to Canada, although my wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:50.240
thinks that sometimes but for other reasons.
When I was playing chess in the late 1960s,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:56.800
I was living by myself in Europe. Nixon&nbsp;
got elected. I felt about Nixon the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.960
I think a lot of people in your generation&nbsp;
or at least millennials feel about Trump.&nbsp;

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:07.040
I didn’t want to come back to the United&nbsp;
States. So there are a lot of people who talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:12.800
that way. But I think the United States is great.
Countries that are smaller, that aren’t the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:19.120
reserve currency, that don’t have access to&nbsp;
these deep pockets of domestic and foreign&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.240
borrowing—and all of those countries fit into&nbsp;
that framework, they need to be more careful.&nbsp;

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:33.520
This "exorbitant privilege," as you talk about&nbsp;
it, is it possible that one way in which it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:40.640
bad for us is that it allows, or incentivizes&nbsp;
us, to take on more debt than it's wise to?&nbsp;

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:50.720
And especially if this isn’t a permanent advantage&nbsp;
we have. When you’re at the top, you take out this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:56.400
cheap debt. And over time you lose your reserve&nbsp;
status, or it weakens at least, and you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.440
refinance that debt at higher interest rates.
So in the short term, you’re incentivizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.920
this behaviour which is not&nbsp;
sustainable in the long run.&nbsp;

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.800
Is there a political economy explanation&nbsp;
for why that might be bad for us?&nbsp;

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.760
I've heard that argument, but I basically think&nbsp;
it's great for us. It's not just the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:20.000
It’s all of us who borrow less. Do we wish we&nbsp;
were paying higher interest rates? Probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.720
most people who are getting a mortgage right&nbsp;
now feel like our interest rates are plenty&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:28.880
high. They don't need to see them higher.
I think with the exorbitant privilege, there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:36.480
are some drawbacks we don't need to get into.&nbsp;
But it's basically incredibly fantastic if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:43.200
owe $37 trillion as our government does, to be&nbsp;
paying half a percent to a percent less. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:49.200
talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.
Our ability to see what's going on everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:57.760
A lot of what our spying does is using our&nbsp;
exorbitant privilege and the dollar network.&nbsp;

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:05.360
Sanctions. I mentioned, I was in my teens&nbsp;
at the end of the 1960s when I didn't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:09.840
to come back. One reason I didn’t want to come&nbsp;
back was the Vietnam War was pretty terrifying.&nbsp;

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:16.320
I had many friends get drafted. Their brains got&nbsp;
fried by heroin even if they didn’t get killed.&nbsp;

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:23.920
And, sanctions. I'm not saying that we've solved&nbsp;
all our wars with sanctions. But make no mistake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.160
we have used that in place of military&nbsp;
intervention a few times. So that’s been&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:35.440
great. I think losing that, and not appreciating&nbsp;
how important that is, is a terrible blunder&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.440
that we might be making right now.
This is a very naive question. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:44.080
know you address it at length in your book.
I’ll ask the question in the most straightforward&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.120
way and then you can explain what's going on.
How should I think about the fact that we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.040
basically giving the rest of the world&nbsp;
pieces of paper and we're getting real&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:57.840
goods and services in exchange?
Sure, at a high level you can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.360
that they're getting this liquidity or&nbsp;
they're getting this network and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.520
what makes it worth it. But I don’t know, are&nbsp;
we fundamentally getting away with something?&nbsp;

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.720
So just to note, the United Kingdom is&nbsp;
not the reserve currency. They're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.440
the dominant currency. They used to be,&nbsp;
a hundred years ago. They look a lot like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:21.840
us now, with big current account deficits.
That’s actually why Trump was able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.400
strike a deal with them. Because they weren’t&nbsp;
really running a surplus against us, anyway.&nbsp;

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:37.520
They’re over-financialized, even more than we are.
The core of the benefit we get is that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:44.800
borrow by issuing safe assets—if you want to&nbsp;
call our debt safe—and we invest in risky stuff.&nbsp;

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:55.680
Charles Kindleberger, wrote one of the great&nbsp;
books on crises. I had him as a professor at MIT.&nbsp;

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.840
He called us bankers to the world. He&nbsp;
said “Yep, we’re running this deficit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.360
they’re holding a lot of our Treasury bills,&nbsp;
but we are making money hand over fist.”&nbsp;

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:12.480
It’s the same thing as the equity premium&nbsp;
where you hold stocks and it’s not always,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.680
but on average better than holding&nbsp;
bonds. So that’s been very good.&nbsp;

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:23.520
You have the fact that the dollar&nbsp;
is very liquid, the markets.&nbsp;

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:30.160
Say you're a Silicon Valley firm and you're&nbsp;
big enough to issue debt internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.920
I don’t know if any Silicon Valley&nbsp;
firms ever issue debt, but if you did,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:41.760
people will buy it because it’s in dollars.
If you're the same firm in France, forget it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.400
They don’t want to hold euros. Even if you promise&nbsp;
to pay in dollars, they’re not happy about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.200
because your income isn't in dollars.
So it’s been fantastic. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:57.920
is something that's been debated.
Stephen Miran, who was a Harvard student,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.400
he's the head of Trump’s Council of&nbsp;
Economic Advisers. Very smart guy.&nbsp;

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.840
He's made this clever argument that because&nbsp;
everybody loves our currency, it makes us less&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:17.680
competitive in everything else. It partly hollowed&nbsp;
out our manufacturing and that’s terrible.&nbsp;

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.880
There’s a little bit of truth to that.&nbsp;
First of all, the dollar goes like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.240
so it’s not always high.
Second, I mentioned the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.600
United Kingdom is kind of in the same boat.
We’re good at a lot of things. We’re good at tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:38.880
Tech makes the dollar stronger, make no mistake.
We’re good at biotech, agriculture. We’re good at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.560
a lot of other things that make the dollar high.
And if you’re good at these things, it’s harder&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.840
to be good at manufacturing. It&nbsp;
bids up the cost of everything.&nbsp;

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:57.920
On the whole, we’re performing this banking&nbsp;
function. That’s really the big thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:07.440
It’s been going on since the ’50s and ’60s. That’s&nbsp;
the core of our so-called exorbitant privilege.&nbsp;

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.880
There’s a really interesting book&nbsp;
by Charles Mann. I think it's called&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:18.160
1493. It’s about how during the Ming Dynasty in&nbsp;
17th-century China, they kept issuing different&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:23.680
paper currencies and it was super unstable. People&nbsp;
in China wanted a reliable medium of exchange.&nbsp;

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.000
So tens of thousands of tons of silver&nbsp;
from the New World, from the Spanish,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:37.040
would be exchanged for enormous amounts&nbsp;
of real goods exported from China.&nbsp;

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.920
So from the Spanish perspective, they’re&nbsp;
getting shiploads and shiploads of real&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:46.000
goods, and all they’re giving up is this&nbsp;
medium of exchange. I don’t know how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.560
analogous that is to the current situation.
There are countries like Ecuador and others&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:57.200
that dollarize. They literally use the dollar&nbsp;
and they need dollars. We’re able to have them&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:03.520
hold dollars. It’s not silver, but we print it&nbsp;
and they pay very low interest rates. They’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.200
holding Treasury bills, not physical dollars.&nbsp;
Yeah, it’s fantastic for us. We definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:14.480
pay less on our debt because of that.
That’s a fascinating example you bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.800
up. The Chinese actually invented the printing&nbsp;
press. They invented paper currency way before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:27.200
Europeans. But then, what do you know, they kept&nbsp;
printing a lot of it and had a lot of inflation.&nbsp;

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.520
I hadn’t read that book, but it’s a great&nbsp;
example. I knew they were using silver,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:41.360
but that number is bigger than I had heard.
Final question. A big part of your book&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:48.400
discusses the different countries which seemed at&nbsp;
different times to be real competitors to America.&nbsp;

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:56.160
You talk about the Soviet Union, Japan, China&nbsp;
today. We've discussed why they didn’t pan out.&nbsp;

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.760
We can go into the details on any one of those&nbsp;
examples, but in the big picture is there some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:07.280
explanation that generalizes across all these&nbsp;
examples of why America has been so competitive?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.560
Or why it's been so hard to displace?
It’s not just that we’ve stayed on top,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:22.240
we’ve just gone like this. Remember, in the 1970s,&nbsp;
Europe actually peeled away from the dollar bloc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:28.400
But the rest of the world started globalizing.&nbsp;
China globalized. Eventually the Soviet Union,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:35.600
and the dollar just colonized all these places.
They were all holding dollar debt, using dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:41.680
It’s much bigger than even the British pound was&nbsp;
when the sun never set on the British Empire.&nbsp;

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:50.240
So it’s been amazing and surprising to people&nbsp;
like myself. If you read what everyone was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:56.320
saying at the time, it was just that it kept&nbsp;
going up. That our share of everything kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.760
getting bigger and bigger.
Definitely, to some extent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.800
we’ve been lucky. We talked about Japan.
I think China made a big mistake by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.800
sticking to the dollar so long.
Europe should have delayed bringing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.360
Greece into the Euro, because their&nbsp;
crisis wouldn’t have been so bad.&nbsp;

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:22.720
So we’ve been fortunate with blunders by&nbsp;
our opposition. We’ve done some good things.&nbsp;

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:28.320
But I think the thing Americans forget&nbsp;
is that we have been lucky a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:36.720
times. I worry our luck is wearing thin.
I quote a chess player—the great Bent Larsen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:42.160
who was number two to Bobby Fischer when&nbsp;
I was playing. He was asked, “Would you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:48.000
rather be lucky or good in a chess game?”
And he said, “Both.” So I think Americans&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.720
forget. They know we’re good and we&nbsp;
are good. We’ve talked about dynamism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:58.560
this secret sauce that we’ve had so far. But&nbsp;
I think we’ve also been lucky. If you ran it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:06.400
all again, it didn’t have to go the same way.
It’s a very scary kind of luck. If it’s so easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:12.640
for these other countries to make some mistake&nbsp;
that causes them to totally fall behind, it should&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.360
update you in favor of the idea that, in general,&nbsp;
it’s easy for a country to get itself in a rut.&nbsp;

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:22.480
It’s like the Fermi estimate thing. The fact&nbsp;
that you don’t see other alien civilizations&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.320
is actually very scary, because it suggests&nbsp;
that there’s some kind of filter which makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:36.160
it really hard to keep your civilization going.
I hope not, but we’ll see. It’s certainly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.360
been amazing how the dollar’s&nbsp;
done and how the US has done.&nbsp;

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:47.120
I hope we continue, but we are doing a lot&nbsp;
of things right now… I don’t think Trump is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:51.920
the cause of the dollar being in gentle&nbsp;
decline. That’s just wrong. I think it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:56.160
would’ve happened with Harris winning.
But he is the president at the moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:01.920
and things like Liberation Day… I’ve&nbsp;
talked to tech people who think it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:09.120
just brilliant. I understand that. We can&nbsp;
debate it. I’m happy to debate it with them.&nbsp;

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:16.080
We look at the rule of law. Okay, I’m sitting at&nbsp;
Harvard University. Naturally it feels that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:21.880
But also we talked about the president being&nbsp;
able to remove all the independent agencies.&nbsp;

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.800
It used to be that if you were a foreign&nbsp;
investor and you invested in the United States,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:31.680
you thought you’d get your money back. Maybe the&nbsp;
stock would’ve gone down. Maybe the real estate&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:38.640
you bought would’ve gone down. But you’d get paid.
I think we were more exceptional than most about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:50.000
that. That’s in doubt now. There’s no question.
The book’s about a lot of things besides&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
exorbitant privilege, the whole arc of the US.&nbsp;
But when I was telling people about the book, “I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.720
don’t know, I’m looking at the numbers,&nbsp;
I’m looking at what China’s doing, I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.000
reading about Europe and their central bank&nbsp;
digital currency. I think we’re going downhill.”&nbsp;

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.480
I showed it to academics, I showed it to financial&nbsp;
people, I showed it to tech people. They said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:13.440
“You’re nuts.” They didn’t want to think&nbsp;
about it. I don’t know if I’m right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.560
But I think it’s worth thinking about.
When I was in China, I met up with some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:25.760
venture capitalists there and they were quite&nbsp;
depressed in general. Even founders say it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:31.920
hard to raise money. I was asking them why, and&nbsp;
they said investors don’t want to invest because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:36.320
even if you invest in the next Alibaba, who’s&nbsp;
to say the government doesn’t cancel the IPO?&nbsp;

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:44.640
They’re in trouble. Yeah. I think Europe has&nbsp;
a bright future in this context, of being the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:50.240
team that doesn’t have as many injured players.
But yeah, China… it’s not going to be forever,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.920
but I think for five or ten years&nbsp;
they’re going to stay in trouble.&nbsp;

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.080
Okay. Thank you so much for sitting down&nbsp;
with me and also answering all my questions.&nbsp;

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.200
I’m sure there are many misconceptions&nbsp;
and naive questions and so forth.&nbsp;

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.920
I appreciate your patience and&nbsp;
you educating me on this topic.&nbsp;

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:09.920
No, it’s an honor to be on your famous&nbsp;
podcast. I heard from so many young&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:16.080
people when I told them I was talking to you.
They were like, “You're with Dwarkesh? Just fly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:21.120
back from here! Do whatever you need to do!”
So I’m glad you were able to come here.&nbsp;

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:28.400
It’s really been interesting, and I’m glad&nbsp;
to learn more about everything you’re doing.&nbsp;

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.120
The honor’s mine. It was great to be&nbsp;
able to travel here and speak with you.
