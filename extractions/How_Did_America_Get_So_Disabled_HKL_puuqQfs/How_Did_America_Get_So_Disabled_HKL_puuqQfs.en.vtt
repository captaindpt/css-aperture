00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
America is more disabled than it has ever been&nbsp;
before. Despite advances in medical technology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.080
better treatments, and a better understanding of&nbsp;
nutrition and health, the size of the disabled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.680
population has grown by more than 30% within the&nbsp;
last 5 years alone, despite the total population&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.280
only growing by 3%. For 3 years after CO, the&nbsp;
number of disabled people in America was growing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.720
faster than the number of people in America. In&nbsp;
some counties across the country, more than one in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.120
three people are out of work due to a disability.&nbsp;
And support payments are now the second largest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.160
budget item for the Social Security Administration&nbsp;
after retirement benefits. Disability payments now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.960
cost more money every year than food stamps&nbsp;
and welfare combined by a significant margin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.240
In some towns across America, banks and stores&nbsp;
stay open late for one night a month, the day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.360
that disability checks become available. This is&nbsp;
clearly a big enough problem by itself, but there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.640
is a lot more going on behind these numbers, which&nbsp;
tell a rather scary story about everything from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.360
the ways we decide if people are worthy to work,&nbsp;
regional inequality, and the long-term realities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.200
of AI in the workplace. I know it sounds unhinged,&nbsp;
but I promise it's all connected. You might not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.160
believe it, but people didn't magically just&nbsp;
become more disabled overnight. Nor are certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.160
areas of the country somehow just 400% more&nbsp;
accident prone than others. So why the has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.560
America really become so disabled? Daniel Waldrip&nbsp;
suffered with chronic back pain for 20 years. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.960
was getting progressively worse through the years.&nbsp;
It just became part of life. Employment rate for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.280
US workers with disabilities increased to about&nbsp;
12.6%. Proposed cuts to Medicaid are creating a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.520
deep sense of fear among 15 million Americans with&nbsp;
disabilities who rely on that program. Back pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.400
is the second most common reason that people&nbsp;
go to the doctor in the United States. and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.920
leading cause of disability in Americans under&nbsp;
the age of 45. One of the recent challenges of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.560
addressing the disability epidemic is that nobody&nbsp;
really wants to acknowledge it for two separate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.360
reasons. The first is that there really are a lot&nbsp;
of vulnerable people out there that genuinely need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.600
this assistance to survive. I hope it's not too&nbsp;
much of a hot take to say that if we can afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.520
more aircraft carriers than the rest of the&nbsp;
world combined, we can afford to look after our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.920
own people. But even just daring to question the&nbsp;
validity of some of these numbers is a dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.720
game because no politician wants to be seen&nbsp;
pushing society's most vulnerable people off vital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.000
support. Not directly anyway, and we will get to&nbsp;
that later. The second and more honest reason is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.360
that people who are out of work due to disability&nbsp;
do not show up on unemployment statistics. To be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.400
officially classified as unemployed, you need to&nbsp;
not have a job and be actively looking for work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.560
adhering to some pretty rigid requirements.&nbsp;
People who are disabled enough to receive support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.520
payments normally don't meet these requirements&nbsp;
even if they are willing to work. So they just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.000
get counted as outside the labor force. If&nbsp;
this was thoroughly reclassified, it might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.720
reveal that job losses are a fair bit worse than&nbsp;
we would all like to admit. And spoiler alert,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.280
there may be a reason why spikes in disability&nbsp;
applications line up almost perfectly with spikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.920
in long-term unemployment. But I am getting&nbsp;
ahead of myself. The first thing you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.040
know is exactly what kind of disabilities we are&nbsp;
getting. A report by NPR and data from the Social&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.600
Security Administration found that diagnoses of&nbsp;
disabled workers had changed dramatically over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.480
decades. And these changes were not what you would&nbsp;
expect. From when the data was first collected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.960
to when the report was published, the rate of&nbsp;
heart disease, stroke, neurological disorders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.400
and broadly defined other disabilities all dropped&nbsp;
significantly. This is surprising because since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.360
the 1960s, the average American has put on a few&nbsp;
pounds. To put it lightly, what exactly are you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.120
trying to say? What exactly am I trying to say?&nbsp;
These are a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] elephants. Anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.600
it's good to know that as someone who personally&nbsp;
enjoys some high fructose corn syrup from time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.400
time, both the reduction in cardiovascular and&nbsp;
neurological disorders was thanks to improved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.160
treatments, which means that medical issues&nbsp;
that would have made people unemployable in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.520
the 1960s can now be managed effectively enough&nbsp;
that people can live totally normal lives. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.200
is particularly impressive when you remember that&nbsp;
you can't be disabled if you are dead. Improving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.280
the survivability of something like a heart attack&nbsp;
also increases the likelihood of that person being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.840
disabled by the incident instead of just killed by&nbsp;
it. So medical treatments have improved and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.560
improved even more to overcome the problems caused&nbsp;
by their statistical improvements. With such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.960
amazing new technology and procedures, we should&nbsp;
surely be living through a golden age of health,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.880
right? But clearly we aren't. So then what&nbsp;
has taken their place and made up most of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.240
increases in disability? Well, it's been mental&nbsp;
illness, which isn't surprising since we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.440
gotten much better at diagnosing these. But above&nbsp;
all, by a wide margin, the biggest increase has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.240
been in back pain and other spinal problems,&nbsp;
which are now more than four times as common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.960
as they were back when we started collecting this&nbsp;
data. These are now the most common diagnoses that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.840
make people unable to work, at least so far as the&nbsp;
government is concerned. Now, it's at this point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.640
that you might understandably get a bit suspicious&nbsp;
of the data because conveniently, these kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.080
disabilities don't show as many physical symptoms&nbsp;
and therefore are a lot easier to fake. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.120
especially suspicious if everybody within a local&nbsp;
area is all coming down with the same disabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.240
when just a few counties over people don't seem&nbsp;
to have the same problems. To make matters worse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.720
I am going to guess that most of you know someone&nbsp;
who can still get a day's work done despite their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.320
back pain. Well, the author of this report, Hana&nbsp;
Joffy Walt, actually thought the same thing. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.880
they went to interview a doctor in one of the most&nbsp;
disabled counties in the country and got a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.200
startling insight into how this whole system&nbsp;
actually worked. One of the doctor's primary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.400
concerns was what level of education his patients&nbsp;
had attained. According to the report, he very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.880
candidly explained that even though this was not a&nbsp;
medical question, it was one of the most important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.600
variables when it came to treating disabling&nbsp;
illnesses. People who had graduated high school or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.520
obtained a college degree had a much better chance&nbsp;
of finding a job where they could sit down if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.640
needed to, like those in an office or even just&nbsp;
a call center. People who did not have a formal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.360
education, however, would most likely be working&nbsp;
jobs behind a counter, making deliveries, or doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.920
manual labor where they were expected to be on&nbsp;
their feet all day. Someone with chronic back pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.720
could work an office job, but even a retail job&nbsp;
that required them to stand for an entire shift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.320
would be impossible. In the interview, the doctor&nbsp;
rather hauntingly said that if you have particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.920
back pain and a college degree, you're not&nbsp;
disabled. Without a college degree, you are. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.280
was a bigger problem in poorer rural working-class&nbsp;
areas where sit-down jobs were more scarce anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.400
which is just one of the reasons why disability&nbsp;
lines up almost perfectly with poverty. People in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.880
poorer areas are not necessarily more disabled.&nbsp;
They just have fewer options outside of giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.480
up and claiming disability. But that is just&nbsp;
one reason, and it's clearly still the sign of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.160
a broken system that's not really helping anybody.&nbsp;
And the worst part is that a lot of these problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.120
would be extremely easy to fix without spending&nbsp;
nearly as much. So, it's time to learn how many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.760
works to find out what these convenient numbers&nbsp;
are really covering up. This video was made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.320
possible by Plaude. Have you ever walked out of&nbsp;
a meeting thinking, "What did we even talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.480
for the last half hour?" Or maybe you've had&nbsp;
moments where you really wanted to take notes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.240
but you were too busy actually being present. It's&nbsp;
the difference between a meeting that's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.960
worthwhile and something that should have been&nbsp;
just an email. Luckily, there's a solution. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.400
called the Plaude Note. An AI tool that actually&nbsp;
helps you do better work instead of just replacing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.120
work with generated slop. Plaud builds cutting&nbsp;
edge tools that help you stay focused on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.920
moment by taking care of all your note-taking and&nbsp;
summarizing. The Notepen is one of their standout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.160
products. It's a small wearable device that you&nbsp;
clip onto your shirt, bag, or lanyard. With one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.400
press, it records your conversations, voice memos,&nbsp;
and meetings, then transcribes and organizes them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.120
into smart summaries you can review later. You can&nbsp;
use it during your lectures, meetings, interviews,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.520
anytime you need to capture everything. I've been&nbsp;
using my notepin on my morning walks when creative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.080
ideas hit. Instead of stopping to grab my phone or&nbsp;
scramble for a notebook, I just tap the notepin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.960
talk it out, and later in the app, it's all turned&nbsp;
into a clear mind map or action list. It saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.160
me so much mental load. It allows you to take&nbsp;
notes anywhere, anytime. It extracts insights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.560
boosts efficiencies, and saves you time. And&nbsp;
you can fully engage in any conversation. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.480
can check it out and get yours using the link&nbsp;
in the description. The NPR article that first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.120
reported on the questionable relationship between&nbsp;
disability and poverty was first published over a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.680
decade ago now. Now, it's still genuinely one&nbsp;
of the best pieces of journalism I have read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.880
in a long time. So, I will leave a link to&nbsp;
it below. However, since then, the number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.840
people receiving disability support payments has&nbsp;
actually gone down, especially amongst people of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.320
working age, which sounds like a good thing,&nbsp;
right? Well, not exactly. Since 2014, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.800
support payments peaked, the number of disabled&nbsp;
people has increased by more than 7 million,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.760
and we still don't have concrete data on people&nbsp;
suffering from symptoms of long co. So with more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.640
disabled people but less people getting disability&nbsp;
support, the actual improvements have really just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.440
been made in bureaucracy. According to data&nbsp;
from the Social Security Administration itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.600
the fastest growing group of applicants are those&nbsp;
waiting to see if they are eligible to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.720
support payments at all. Just the statistical&nbsp;
increase in administrative delay accounts for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.040
almost all of the reductions seen in people&nbsp;
on disability support. Successive governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.360
have realized that cutting down on staff at the&nbsp;
Social Security Administration not only reduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.960
costs from the payroll itself, but it also&nbsp;
means that there are less people available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.840
to process support requests, which conveniently&nbsp;
saves money in a less direct way. According to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.240
the administration's own data visualized by&nbsp;
the Urban Institute, wait times for people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.480
just seeing if they are eligible for support&nbsp;
have more than doubled. And in certain states,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.800
people are now waiting for over a year just to see&nbsp;
if they can be technically qualified as disabled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.440
to qualify for support. People who genuinely need&nbsp;
the support don't normally have the means to wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.560
this long. So, they are just giving up and either&nbsp;
relying on family or falling into poverty. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.480
rest of the reduction in disability support is&nbsp;
made up of people who are denied on technical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.280
grounds rather than medical grounds. According to&nbsp;
the law firms that regularly process these claims,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.360
the hoops to jump through in order to receive&nbsp;
support have become significantly more difficult,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.080
and denials can be made for any number of reasons&nbsp;
at any point throughout the year-long process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.080
The reason for these denials can include not&nbsp;
adhering to a regular treatment schedule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.480
which does sound reasonable, but can be almost&nbsp;
impossible for people without insurance or an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.960
income. Another reason could be moving in with&nbsp;
family members while waiting for support. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.520
their household income is too high, it can be&nbsp;
grounds for denial. Since these reports are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.440
coming out of law firms, there is also some&nbsp;
natural selection bias towards claimants who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.960
can well afford to pay for lawyers. This is yet&nbsp;
another reason why wealthier areas tend to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.000
lower reported rates of disability. In places&nbsp;
with better job opportunities, it becomes worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.560
it to pay for support in order to maintain gainful&nbsp;
employment. Disability payments are not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.360
cover the cost of living in most areas with even&nbsp;
a moderate cost of living. And in poorer areas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.240
treatments are going to cost more than most people&nbsp;
will pay in taxes from even a full-time job. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.560
unfortunately, the simplest solution has become&nbsp;
to just throw some cash their way and ignore the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.040
problem. Now, the federal government has pushed&nbsp;
back on this trend because they saw it becoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.120
a massive cost center that was just being abused.&nbsp;
And hot take alert, they were absolutely right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.760
just not in the way you might expect. There are&nbsp;
a lot of people who are making a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.400
off the so-called disability industrial complex.&nbsp;
It's just not the people receiving the payments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.360
themselves. The first group is a growing roster&nbsp;
of consulting firms. Unemployment welfare costs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.520
are paid in part by state governments. This was&nbsp;
pushed heavily by the federal government as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.680
way to motivate state governments to get their&nbsp;
people back to work. This did work to bring down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.680
the people on this type of support, but not&nbsp;
really in the way that old Billy Boy might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.640
have hoped. States quickly realized that they&nbsp;
had to share the cost of unemployment benefits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.000
but not disability benefits. This created an&nbsp;
opportunity for private consulting companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.920
to work with state governments to go through&nbsp;
their welfare roles to try and find people that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.040
could qualify as disabled. According to a specific&nbsp;
example from the NPR report, Missouri was paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.880
these firms $2,300 per person who they could move&nbsp;
off of unemployment benefits and onto disability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.680
benefits. Since these consulting firms were paid&nbsp;
on a per person basis, they would allegedly talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.680
to people directly and give them advice on how&nbsp;
to play up their symptoms and think of additional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.760
medical problems they might have. For the state,&nbsp;
it was a great deal because they wouldn't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.920
pay to cover for these services anymore. And they&nbsp;
would have more federal funding coming into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.640
state through disability payments. This let state&nbsp;
politicians talk about their fiscally conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.920
credentials by actively exploiting welfare&nbsp;
programs. Clearly for the country at large,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.560
this was not a good idea because most people&nbsp;
who receive unemployment benefits eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.560
rejoin the workforce. People on disability are far&nbsp;
less likely even if they would be physically able.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.600
The second group that have really benefited from&nbsp;
all of this are the lawyers. Many law offices now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.720
specialize exclusively in processing and pushing&nbsp;
through disability claims. And the more the system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.840
gets bogged down in bureaucracy, the more money&nbsp;
they stand to make. So yeah, yet another system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.080
that was originally made to perform a basic&nbsp;
function that has been corrupted by misaligned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.600
incentives, and now it's too profitable to repeal.&nbsp;
Throw in some depressing graphs and welcome to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.880
basically every video on this channel. However,&nbsp;
the bigger problem with the disability industrial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.880
complex is what it's covering up. The job market&nbsp;
has clearly changed a lot since we started playing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.000
these games with welfare back in the mid1 1990s.&nbsp;
China entered the World Trade Organization and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.440
outsourcing pushed entire regions into redundancy.&nbsp;
The idea for a long time was that people would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.320
retrained into more technical roles to replace&nbsp;
the basic manufacturing jobs that were lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.480
For individuals who had spent their entire lives&nbsp;
working with their hands, it was a bit optimistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.000
to expect them to just learn to code. And for&nbsp;
certain regions, it has been devastating. Those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.720
who could leave areas in the rust belt already&nbsp;
have predominantly younger workers follow job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.040
opportunities and according to the data they are&nbsp;
earning good incomes compared to the national&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.840
average. Those who were left behind have suffered&nbsp;
as opportunities have gone elsewhere alongside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.200
young educated workers. People aren't more likely&nbsp;
to be disabled in these areas. They are just more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.640
likely to be in the group that stays. Today,&nbsp;
however, the script is reversing once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.640
People who have spent their lives learning to&nbsp;
code or perform basically any job where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.200
sit behind a computer are being told they are&nbsp;
right on the edge of being replaced by AI. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.600
they better start learning to work with their&nbsp;
hands again. As I was researching this very video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.000
Marvin Ellison, the CEO of Lowe's, made headlines&nbsp;
for telling his employees to stay away from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.400
corporate office and as close to the cash register&nbsp;
as possible if they didn't want to be laid off and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.320
replaced by AI. That's a little bit tone-deaf from&nbsp;
the guy that will be doing the laying off. But if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.760
the promises of the AI CEOs are to be believed,&nbsp;
he might not be wrong. The problem is that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.080
could further expose the disability gap. Because&nbsp;
remember, there are lots of disabled people that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.280
can work behind a computer but can't work in&nbsp;
physical roles. Now, making big loud warnings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.760
about AI systems taking everybody's job is a great&nbsp;
way for tech companies to raise a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.480
from people who like the idea of cutting out labor&nbsp;
costs. So, you need to take these warnings with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.000
bucket of salt. What isn't hypothetical, though,&nbsp;
is that we are getting older. Age naturally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.880
makes disability more prevalent, and it's also&nbsp;
increasing the expectation that we will work later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.840
into our lives at the same time. The demographic&nbsp;
problems that come with an aging population are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.800
far beyond the scope of this video. But so far as&nbsp;
being able to get to work as we get old, there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:19.200
some simple realities we need to accept. Some jobs&nbsp;
can easily be done into old age. Others cannot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.040
According to the Harvard Law Review, the average&nbsp;
age of a federal court judge is now 69 years old,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.760
two years above the normal retirement age outlined&nbsp;
by the Social Security Administration. And don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.800
even get me started on the Senate. Anyway, these&nbsp;
are prestigious jobs that are not physically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.240
demanding and come with a lot of support built in.&nbsp;
A job like a roofer or boiler maker is simply not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.960
going to be as easy for older people to do. If we&nbsp;
want people to start scaling into more physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.680
jobs, we also need to accept that they will not be&nbsp;
able to work as long or else all of the problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.880
with our current disability system are going to&nbsp;
get exponentially worse. But it doesn't need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.480
be this extreme. There are a lot of easy and best&nbsp;
of all cheap changes that could be made right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.520
that would go a long way to unf--ing this mess.&nbsp;
Letting retail workers sit at checkouts instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.760
of standing in place all day immediately makes&nbsp;
one of the most common jobs in the country far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.200
more accessible. So does encouraging businesses&nbsp;
to let people work from home. Right to sit laws do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.160
exist for already disabled people as a reasonable&nbsp;
accommodation. But in the real world, that puts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.040
them at a disadvantage when trying to get or keep&nbsp;
a job where standing is the expectation. Right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.360
to sit laws actually used to be universal for&nbsp;
everybody across almost every single state. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.400
they were slowly repealed because large employers,&nbsp;
in particular McDonald's Ray Croc, lobbied state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.640
governments arguing that it made workers look&nbsp;
unprofessional and lazy. Using slogans like, "If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.360
you got time to lean, you've got time to clean."&nbsp;
Simple changes like this won't fix the problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.720
entirely, but they will help without costing much,&nbsp;
and they should be politically popular, too. To&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.120
the people that think assistance recipients are&nbsp;
just ripping off the taxpayer, this gets rid of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.080
excuse. And to everybody else, it makes it easier&nbsp;
to get their work done, all while helping people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.440
help themselves. But of course, we won't do it&nbsp;
because business incentives bad decisions. Go and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.920
watch this video next to find out why we keep on&nbsp;
making the same kind of dumb mistakes and why they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.440
are so hard to correct. And don't forget to like&nbsp;
