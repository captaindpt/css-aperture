00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.800
Two months ago, UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer&nbsp;
signed an agreement that will transfer the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.000
sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory&nbsp;
to the independent nation of Maitius. This place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.440
is honestly barely worth mentioning. It has zero&nbsp;
inhabitants apart from temporary naval personnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.480
and its total land area is only 21 square miles at&nbsp;
low tide. However, the steel once it is finished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.160
in the courts will have one big symbolic side&nbsp;
effect. Losing this dot on the map at 71 degrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.520
east will mean that for about 120 days next&nbsp;
year the sun will set on the British Empire. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.560
for a lot of people back in the UK itself this&nbsp;
symbolic decline is not exactly surprising. 20&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.440
years ago it was one of the fastest growing major&nbsp;
economies in the world. But today it's completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.400
paralyzed because of some all too familiar&nbsp;
problems. The collapse of a trading empire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.840
over financialization, single city centralization,&nbsp;
housing unaffordability, wealth concentration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.640
reckless privatization, corporate consolidation,&nbsp;
brain drain, a perceived overdependence on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.440
wealthy, a public private sector revolving door&nbsp;
resulting in limpisted regulation, a debt crisis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.240
and reactionary policy, all fueled by the&nbsp;
ideas that just don't work anymore. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.680
problems are clearly not unique to the UK. But&nbsp;
they saw what everybody else was doing and said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.160
"Hold my warm beer and baked beans. We can do it&nbsp;
better. The UK is now the best place to invest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.640
creating 384,000 jobs. In this current job market,&nbsp;
it is tough to get a job. Told the British people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200
she wouldn't change the debt target. While&nbsp;
debt's going up and spending's going up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.480
you think a big influx of millionaires to London&nbsp;
would push up property prices even further. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.160
is happening now? Terrible economic mismanagement.&nbsp;
One of the common issues in the UK is that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.240
are actually a few things that are working&nbsp;
really well, which sounds like a good thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.680
right? The problem is to keep the few things that&nbsp;
are working going, other major sacrifices need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.720
be made, which leaves most people worse off. The&nbsp;
city of London and the surrounding metropolitan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.400
areas are still doing very well, as long as you&nbsp;
don't look too closely. Its GDP per capita is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.480
some of the highest anywhere in the world, and the&nbsp;
only countries that beat it have far fewer people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.000
and normally a generous helping of oil or tax&nbsp;
loopholes. London has roughly the same population&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.440
and the same GDP as all of Switzerland. And&nbsp;
when counted separately from the rest of the UK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.920
it's actually growing faster than the Swiss,&nbsp;
too. This is mainly because London is the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.080
largest financial center in the world, only&nbsp;
slightly behind New York. Now, you might think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.800
that this doesn't really make much sense. New York&nbsp;
has the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120
which are almost as large as every other&nbsp;
exchange in the world combined. And obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.320
they dwarf the London Stock Exchange. New York&nbsp;
is also home to the two largest non-government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.000
banks in the world, and it has more than twice the&nbsp;
population. But London punches above its weight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.560
offering financial services that are really quite&nbsp;
symbolic of the country's broader issues. Which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.880
is why to understand the current problems in the&nbsp;
UK, you need to understand the basics of London's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.920
financial system. The finance industry in London&nbsp;
isn't really concerned with trading companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.800
To do that, they would need successful companies&nbsp;
in the first place. In fact, a lot of the largest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.040
British companies to go public in recent years&nbsp;
have done it in America instead since the London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.760
Stock Exchange was too small to bother with. So,&nbsp;
where New York has built its financial center&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.840
around financing the world's most valuable&nbsp;
companies, London instead does most of its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.120
work providing financial services to the world's&nbsp;
richest people. New York may be where institutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.160
go if they need to make a lot of money. But London&nbsp;
is where they go if they already have it. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.040
some of this is by coincidence. London is&nbsp;
conveniently located between America and Asia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.200
which when combined with the pound's historic&nbsp;
dominance has made it a convenient time zone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.440
to use as a foreign exchange hub. According to&nbsp;
the Bank for International Settlements, about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.200
40% of global foreign exchange volume goes through&nbsp;
London, which is more than double the runner up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.560
London also dominates in wealth management, which&nbsp;
is just finance bros speak for shuffling rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.040
people's money around to achieve certain goals&nbsp;
and charging a fee on it in the process. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.040
they are obviously pretty damn good at&nbsp;
this because financial services are now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.440
the country's number one export. They bring in&nbsp;
more money by consulting on how to move money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.680
around than they do by selling cars, machinery,&nbsp;
oil, and precious metals combined. In 2023,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.440
the UK brought in the equivalent of $ 160 billion&nbsp;
in revenue just from these services, according to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.720
the City of London's own data. So, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;
are these people actually doing? Well, you might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.640
think that the goals that wealthy international&nbsp;
clientele have with their money is just to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.680
it into more money, right? But that's actually&nbsp;
only a small part of the story. A Robin Hood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.640
account could handle that part. The real money is&nbsp;
made in alternative investments, tax structuring,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.400
legal structuring, and providing a nice safe place&nbsp;
to park cash, ill gotten or otherwise. London has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.800
been an incredibly popular place for some of the&nbsp;
richest people in the world to base themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.840
because it really is a one-stop shop for anything&nbsp;
they and their money would ever need. World class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.000
law firms to make sure that the family trust&nbsp;
is set up properly. Ultra luxury real estate to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.720
park a few hundred million. International tax&nbsp;
experts to structure holding companies in all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.160
the wrong places. London really does it all.&nbsp;
And this is one other thing that makes London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.600
really popular. A 2017 study by the University of&nbsp;
Amsterdam tracked the transfer of money into low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.400
tax and low regulation jurisdiction to find out&nbsp;
where it was all ending up. Now, they did a whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.280
lot of nerdy math in detailed forensic accounting,&nbsp;
but I want to play a little game. I want to see if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.520
you can recognize a pattern in this research.&nbsp;
Some of the top destinations for this money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.640
was the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the&nbsp;
Cayman Islands, and the Marshall Islands. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.840
since I can already hear Patrick Bole furiously&nbsp;
typing in my comment section, yes, most of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.480
business done in London is above board, but&nbsp;
even these legitimate operations have become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.280
dependent on a foundation of questionable cash.&nbsp;
For example, Lloyds of London is a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.840
like a stock exchange, but for insuring things.&nbsp;
It's a market where underwriters and brokers come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.960
together to create contracts for complex, unusual,&nbsp;
or high-risk things like ships, satellites, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.200
basically anything that you couldn't go to Geico&nbsp;
for. One of the reasons this industry has remained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.800
so dominant in London is because insurance takes&nbsp;
a deep pool of capital and amicable regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.280
Sometimes insurance brokers will want to write a&nbsp;
policy for an oil tanker that may or may not be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.400
abiding by US State Department sanctions. That's&nbsp;
obviously not going to fly in New York, but London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.520
has always been a little bit more accommodating.&nbsp;
The old team at Micro did a great video recently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.400
on exactly how shady that whole industry can be.&nbsp;
And the point here is that the shadyiest part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.400
a shady industry is conducted in London. Now, I&nbsp;
know it's not exactly breaking news that London's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.760
financial system has been used for some unsavory&nbsp;
purposes, and that's not the point of this video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.720
The problem is now that London has become the only&nbsp;
reliably growing component of the UK's economy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.640
which means that the government has routinely&nbsp;
and consistently made sacrifices to keep it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.360
turnurning, often by neglecting the rest of the&nbsp;
country. This has obviously been bad for regular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.280
people who have been left behind by the games of&nbsp;
the global financial system. It's been bad for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.760
traditional industries in the country. And in a&nbsp;
cruel twist of irony, it hasn't even been good for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.400
the city itself. The millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;
that London pandered so hard to accommodate are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.680
now leaving in record numbers. So, it's time to&nbsp;
learn how money works to find out how the UK let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.520
it get this bad. This week's video is sponsored&nbsp;
by Bootdev, a platform I've actually been using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.080
myself to brush up on my backend skills. Bootdev&nbsp;
is learning to solve one of the biggest issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.880
with learning to code online. Boredom. They've&nbsp;
built a platform that feels more like a game than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.440
a course using smart design to keep you engaged&nbsp;
while you're building real coding skills that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.400
actually matter in a job setting. It's all focused&nbsp;
on back-end web development. So, you'll be writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.360
a ton of code from day one in languages like&nbsp;
Python, Go, and TypeScript. The lessons balance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.080
theory and practice. And unlike a lot of tutorials&nbsp;
that just explain concepts, Bootdev makes sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.320
you're constantly applying what you learn by&nbsp;
working through real projects. I've been going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.400
through their data structures and algorithms in&nbsp;
Python course, and I genuinely think it's one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.760
the best structured coding courses I've ever used.&nbsp;
You earn XP, level up, unlock spells in your spell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.800
book, and yes, there's even an AI wizard bearer&nbsp;
named Boots who guides you when you're stuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.120
He doesn't just give you the answer. He asks&nbsp;
the right questions to help you figure it out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.160
which honestly helps stuff click faster for me.&nbsp;
Also worth noting, the content is free to browse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.320
in guest mode, so you can explore the courses&nbsp;
before paying. If you don't want access to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.440
interactive parts, like hands-on coding, progress&nbsp;
tracking, and AI help, there's a paid membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.560
But they offer a full 30-day refund policy, no&nbsp;
questions asked if it's not for you. So, if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.880
serious about learning back-end development and&nbsp;
want to actually enjoy the process, go check out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.080
boot.dev. You can try courses for free. And if&nbsp;
you decide to go allin, use my code moneyworks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.440
to get 25% off your first year on the annual plan.&nbsp;
That's money works and the link is right below the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.360
video. The UK has made major sacrifices to make&nbsp;
themselves attractive to global billionaires.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.280
They have deregulated financial systems,&nbsp;
been led on investigation and enforcement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.920
and allowed for widespread investments into things&nbsp;
like housing, which have pushed out regular Brits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.200
This all happened in less obvious ways, too.&nbsp;
The UK's currency, the pound, is the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.080
financialized currency in the world, which is just&nbsp;
a finance bro way of saying that it gets used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.960
selling financial transactions more than it gets&nbsp;
used for, well, you know, boring stuff like buying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.840
goods and services. The great British pound is the&nbsp;
fourth most traded currency after the US dollar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.720
the euro, and the yen. But both America and&nbsp;
Europe have a much larger overall economy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.080
and trade volumes balance out the speculation.&nbsp;
Japan is also still a much larger economy than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.280
the UK. But the currency is also used to pull a&nbsp;
lot of financial [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like the yen carry trade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.600
where investors will borrow money at low interest&nbsp;
rates in Japan, exchange those yen for something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.240
like American dollars and then use the money to&nbsp;
invest in global markets, hopefully profiting off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.800
the difference between high market returns and&nbsp;
low interest rates. Now, you may not believe it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.360
but there are real consequences to turning your&nbsp;
currency into poker chips to play in the casino of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.560
global markets. It means that the pound is highly&nbsp;
susceptible to big swings in value over relatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.680
minor changes in the real economy. What this does&nbsp;
is makes it harder for real export businesses like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.760
Rolls-Royce jet engines to make deals without&nbsp;
paying a premium to hedge against currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.720
fluctuations between when they make a deal and&nbsp;
when it actually gets paid for. But at least all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.160
these sacrifices have made them a hub for global&nbsp;
billionaires, right? Well, just late last week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.560
one of UK's richest residents, John Frederickson,&nbsp;
announced that he would be leaving the country and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.720
moving to somewhere that was more accommodating&nbsp;
to him and his business interests. In a quote,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.280
he said that the country had gone to hell,&nbsp;
just like his native home, Norway. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.040
according to the human development report,&nbsp;
Norway has the second highest living standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.040
of any country on Earth. So, this does seem a&nbsp;
bit confusing. Some have speculated that what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.000
he actually meant by gone to hell like Norway&nbsp;
was that they would dare to levy taxes on him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.880
like Norway. The coverage of Mr. Frederickson's&nbsp;
great sea change has mostly been focused on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.760
dozens of service staff that will no longer have&nbsp;
a job tending to him and his residents in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.600
It's also been focused on what could be the most&nbsp;
expensive home sale in the country's history as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.800
he moves out of his Chelsea estate called, and I&nbsp;
promise I didn't make this up, the old rectory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:08.720
I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in&nbsp;
2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.280
what's it called now? Urectum. Anyway, this is&nbsp;
not an isolated incident. Frederickson is joining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.840
a wave of high- netw worth individuals moving&nbsp;
out of the UK. In fact, according to a report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.480
by Henley and Partners, an international law firm&nbsp;
that specializes in dealing with wealthy families,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.960
the UK is now losing more wealthy people than&nbsp;
China, even though they have 13 times as many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.600
people overall. The number one reason for this&nbsp;
great exodus is that a lot of these people were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.680
not actually from the UK to begin with. They&nbsp;
moved there because they were attracted to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.920
services it provided without asking for much&nbsp;
in return. But now that the country is trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.080
to get a little bit more serious about raising&nbsp;
tax revenues from these same people, they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.120
once again shopping around for a new place to call&nbsp;
home. Overwhelmingly, these people are moving to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.480
the UAE thanks to a combination of its low taxes&nbsp;
and the same focus on international services.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.440
There was an old saying that if someone will&nbsp;
cheat with you, they will cheat on you. Now, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.040
isn't how relationships work, but the same idea&nbsp;
applies here. For a long time, the UK built up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.440
its domestic pool of capital and the financial hub&nbsp;
by attracting wealthy people that weren't overly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.800
loyal to their home country. Now that those people&nbsp;
aren't showing loyalty to them, they are pulling a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.960
shocked Pikachu. But the real question is, does it&nbsp;
even matter? If these people really weren't paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.520
their fair share of taxes in the first place,&nbsp;
what harm is there in them leaving? If anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.560
they will vacate houses which could add much&nbsp;
needed supply to the real estate market. Right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.440
Wrong. For starters, the houses they are selling&nbsp;
are not exactly ready to be picked up by promising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.160
first time home buyers. High-end real estate in&nbsp;
central London has taken a hit with more listings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.440
and lower demand, but these properties are still&nbsp;
worth several million dollars on the low end.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.400
More broadly though, capital flight is hitting the&nbsp;
UK harder than it would ideally like. All of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.040
industries that depend on moving money around have&nbsp;
less money to move around, and that's hurting one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.400
of the fewer career paths that can still genuinely&nbsp;
let working class people get ahead in the UK. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.640
I know it might be hard to shed a tear for the&nbsp;
British finance bros. But they still put a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.440
of that money back into the regular economy. So,&nbsp;
even though it's not a great system, it's become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.800
one of the few lifelines people have left. Now, in&nbsp;
the long term, this could push for a more balanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.600
economy, but in the short term, it's going to&nbsp;
suck. The UK has become like a shopping mall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.760
filled with nothing but luxury boutiques and tax&nbsp;
accountants. It makes a lot of money while there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.040
are rich people around, but once they leave, it&nbsp;
doesn't have much left to offer. A shopping mall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.360
filled with a wider variety of stores is going to&nbsp;
be a lot better for a lot of people in the long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.400
term, but nobody really wants to commit to the&nbsp;
rebuilding process. Wealthy people leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.040
UK might not have paid their fair share, but they&nbsp;
still pay a lot through things like value added&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.560
taxes and just providing liquidity. Redirecting&nbsp;
the UK away from just financial services means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.200
that political opposition can just point to these&nbsp;
people leaving as a sign of a country in decline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.000
and highlight all of the jobs that housekeepers&nbsp;
are losing. It would be a long, slow, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.800
politically challenging task even when the rest of&nbsp;
the economy was strong. But the government now has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.600
a lot of debt, high borrowing costs, and timid&nbsp;
political support, which are all going to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.640
doing what needs to be done much, much harder. A&nbsp;
lot of the surface level issues that get the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.560
attention can be traced back to not wanting&nbsp;
to upset these people. Chronic underfunding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.880
of services, a reliance on immigration to fill&nbsp;
skill shortages, and rising cost of living are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.640
made worse by not reinvesting or regulating in the&nbsp;
right areas. There are hours of detail about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.160
exactly this is played out, but that's what Gary's&nbsp;
economics is for. The point is, if you don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.400
to end up like the UK, just remember trying&nbsp;
to be the lowest bidder for the global elite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.240
in their money is quite literally a race to the&nbsp;
bottom. If you are from the UK, don't worry. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.920
could be worse. You could be from California.&nbsp;
Wait, faaa.. Go and watch this video next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

mistakes and yet somehow hasn't had to face any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.720
consequences for it yet. And don't forget to like&nbsp;
