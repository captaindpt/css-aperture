00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.040
There's a feud between Iran and the West

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.240
that’s spanned coups, sanctions and standoffs.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.680
“The world's number one state sponsor of terror.”

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.240
“Covert operation to overthrow Mossadegh.”

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.360
“A Shah who had fled to Rome, comes home.”

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.600
“Hundreds of thousands take to the streets.”

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.200
“1979 turned everything upside down.”

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.640
But it didn't start in 1979.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.360
Or with Mossadegh, or even with Iran.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.080
“The largest empire the world had ever seen.”

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.880
It goes back

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.480
over 2000 years to the Persian Empire.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.960
That's where we find one of the oldest stories

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.360
ever told.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.640
The battle of good versus evil

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.080
“Erased from history.”

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.160
Of freedom versus tyranny.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.680
Of valiant West versus despotic East.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.680
“And it’s the victors who write the history books.”

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
“The thousand nations of the Persian Empire

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.080
descend upon you.”

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.840
This origin story helps us

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.640
understand what has been unfolding

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.200
for the past century, continuing into today.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.520
So if you want to understand

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.480
why the West hates Persia,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.120
first you have to understand

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.560
why it worships Greece.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.160
“The finest soldiers the world has ever known.”

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.480
Hi everyone, it’s Tala.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.560
Before we dive deeper, we want to give a special

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.040
thank you to our supporters on Patreon.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.640
Doing this work takes time,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.800
resources, and editorial independence,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.920
so it's wouldn't be possible

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.480
without our supporters online.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.960
If you believe in what we're doing

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.840
and want to be a part of this with us,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.360
you can join our Patreon.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600
It's how we keep this going.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.480
Now back to the video.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
[Chapter I: The Heroes]

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.880
“A people glorious and arrogant. 
Valiant and headstrong.”

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.400
“No other city has shaped the Western world

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800
so much as Athens” 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.080
In Western culture

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.160
Ancient Greece is seen as the cradle

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.120
of philosophy, science,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.880
and most importantly,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.400
as the birthplace of democracy.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.280
Entire university departments

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.400
are dedicated to this era, called the ‘classics’

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400
a name fitting for

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.680
how these contributions are seen:

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.200
as classic, foundational.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.640
That's because the West sees

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.600
ancient Greece

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.560
and Rome

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.480
as the birthplaces of Western civilization.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.960
Not only are you getting

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.120
a better understanding of Greece

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.960
and Western culture,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.320
but you're also sending a signal

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.560
of the continuity

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.400
that exists

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.920
between what happened here

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.920
and what happened with our founding fathers.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.360
This first happened over 300 years ago

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.520
during the Renaissance,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.800
when there was a rebirth of interest

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.360
in ancient Greek art,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.960
literature, philosophy and science

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.040
after the so-called Dark Ages.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.640
Fun fact this rebirth was possible

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.320
because ancient Greek texts

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.000
had been preserved in Arabic.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.120
“Translate these books as soon as possible.”

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.120
Their translation into Latin

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.080
made them accessible

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.680
to Latin Europe, prompting the Renaissance.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.320
Then came the enlightenment,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.680
where the thinkers of the time

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200
were reading and inspired

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.880
by the works of ancient Greece,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.960
and saw themselves

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.880
as inheriting

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.480
the legacy of Greek reason, logic and inquiry.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.960
Athenian democracy

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.520
was a symbolic ancestor for new ideas of liberty

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.920
and citizenship.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.240
Ancient Greece became more than history.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.680
It became an origin story.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.280
The birthplace of Western civilization.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.520
Aristotle is called the father of logic,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.080
Socrates and Plato.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.840
Fathers of philosophy.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.160
But most important for this story.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.080
Herodotus: the father of history,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.720
who is considered

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.280
to have written the first major

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.960
work of historical prose in Western literature,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.920
so that the great and marvelous

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.240
deeds of Greeks and barbarians

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.040
should not go unsung.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.080
And it's the history

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.920
he recorded that would echo through

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.360
Western thought for centuries.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.160
The history of the heroic Greeks

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.360
“The world will know that free men

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.640
stood against a tyrant,”

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.120
against their enemy:

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.280
“Embrace me as your king and as your God”

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.560
The Persians.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.440
“Yes!”

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.840
[Chapter II: The Villains]

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.320
“No Greek would even hear the word Persian

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.400
without terror.”

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.160
“Hundreds of peoples and tribes

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.320
were forced to accept Persian rule

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.840
and submit to a despotic regime.”

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.400
The Persian Empire and Greek city states

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.640
fought many battles

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.400
during a time known as the Greco-Persian Wars

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.800
like Marathon, Salamis and Thermopylae,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.160
which you might know from the movie 300.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.080
“This is where we hold them!”

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.040
and he wrote about them

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.960
not as messy geopolitical struggles,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.960
but as moral epics.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.720
The Greeks were the free and brave underdogs,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.520
fighting for liberty

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.800
against the barbaric and cruel Persian monarchs.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.720
In his writings,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.000
Herodotus helped birth

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.240
the idea of the tyrannical, despotic East.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.960
The tiny state of democratic

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.080
Athens was gaining power.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.160
This was a threat,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.200
that the Persians would have to destroy.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.800
“The Athenians

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.200
slaughtered over 6000 Persians

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.760
in one fateful day.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.280
The world's first democracy had survived

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.480
its first great test.”

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.640
Fast forward 2000 years to the Renaissance,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.080
and the reading of his work

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.320
coincided with another major chapter

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.640
in Western European history.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.520
The discovery of new parts of the world

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.840
new peoples

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.840
peoples we know they would come to see

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.440
as barbaric.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.800
And that framing never really died.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.440
In a way

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.000
he's the father of history

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.640
and of the epic war between the civilized

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.680
and the barbarians.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.720
“Without their success in this conflict,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.360
they would, no doubt, never have 
had the liberty, means,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.320
or conviction

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.800
to invent, discover or create all they did.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.560
Indeed,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.160
most of the cornerstones of modern civilization.”

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.320
The problem is that this whole story

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.320
gets a lot wrong.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.280
“Herodotus’ account of the past

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.560
seems burdened with much invented history.”

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.800
“Almost everything that we know

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.320
about the Persian Empire

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.720
actually comes from Greek sources.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.400
So it was written by the enemies.” 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.640
[Chapter III: The ‘Villains’]

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.800
Here's the reality.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.400
“The greatest empire the world had ever seen.”

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.800
The Persian Empire

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.960
began with the Achaemenid Empire

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.280
and was founded by Kourosh or Cyrus the Great.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.120
It was the largest

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.800
the world had seen, stretching

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.400
from Libya to India

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.600
and home to nearly half the world's population.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.640
But unlike other empires,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.160
it thrived on tolerance.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.000
“And it shows the different peoples of the empire

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.600
bringing their different tributes.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.160
And the Persian Empire

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.480
unlike others,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.240
didn't try to crush people

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.760
into one way of being or doing.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.280
It allowed a great diversity of habits

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.600
and patterns, language and faith

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.000
to live together.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.760
It became the great model

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.160
of how to run an empire of dizzying diversity.”

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
The Cyrus Cylinder guaranteed people

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.720
the right to worship freely

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.280
speak their own languages,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.200
and return to their homelands.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.480
And it's often called the first Bill of rights

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.240
written in 539 B.C.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.240
Cyrus even funded the rebuilding

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.160
of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.920
earning him praise in the Hebrew Bible.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.160
Later, King Daryoosh (Darius the Great)

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.920
would expand this legacy

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.760
building roads, standardizing currency,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.880
and creating an administrative system

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.520
so advanced it became a model for future empires.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.080
Although Cyrus’ Empire was eventually broken up

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.000
the idea of Cyrus himself remained:

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.360
Cyrus as the model ruler.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.240
The principal source

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.280
for that view of Cyrus came from the Greek

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.120
historian Xenophon.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.120
His book Cyropaedia

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.360
was really about how to run an empire,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.160
with Cyrus as the model.”

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.040
Historians and philosophers considered this work

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.560
a masterpiece.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.080
It was also read by Alexander

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.200
the Great, Julius Caesar.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.960
“It was very popular all through the Renaissance,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.520
and particularly

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.880
with the founding Fathers of America.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.480
And we know that Jefferson

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.720
had two, possibly three copies of Xenophon's

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.320
Life of Cyrus and referred to it regularly.”

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.160
“Run along until your Xerxes

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.760
he faces free men here, not slaves.”

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.280
Actually, slavery was frowned

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.160
upon under the Persians.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.560
The Greek city states, on the other hand,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.360
were built on slavery.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.160
In fact,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.680
these Spartan fighters would have each owned

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.000
their own slaves

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.080
who outnumbered Spartans by 7 to 1.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.440
Fearing rebellion,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.840
the Spartans would declare war on their slaves

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.760
annually, allowing them to be killed

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.760
with no legal repercussions.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.920
And they would target slaves deemed strong

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.000
or likely to organize resistance.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.520
As for freedom,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.600
the only people who enjoyed democracy

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.200
in ancient Greece were slave owning men.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.080
And Persian history went on long

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.120
after the Achemenid Empire.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.400
“The frontal-view depictions of Parthian art

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.120
can be found in Christian artworks

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.880
of the Byzantium and  the Middle Ages,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.920
a thousand years after this Empire's reign”

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.120
and continued to contribute to humanity.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.920
Ibn Sina's

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.960
canon of medicine

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.160
shaped European medical education

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
for over six centuries.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.120
Al-Farabi expanded Aristotelian logic,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.680
laying groundwork for later

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.320
Christian and Jewish scholastic thought.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.640
al-Khawarizmi invented algebra

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.960
Al-Biruni accurately

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.240
calculated the Earth's radius centuries

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.440
before Galileo. And there's many more.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.400
These thinkers weren't peripheral.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.160
They were pillars of science,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.040
philosophy, math, medicine,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.600
poetry, architecture, spirituality,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.040
and their translated works

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.720
would become essential reading

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.360
during Europe's Renaissance.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.560
“There is a huge cultural difference

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.760
between the Greeks and the Persians.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.360
It's a struggle between freedom and slavery.”

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.440
History likes to paint in black and white,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.400
West versus East, good versus evil.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.680
But the truth is far more complex.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.480
Civilizations have always exchanged ideas

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.560
borrowed from each other and built together.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.120
Persia was a major part of that story.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.600
“Multilingual teams labored on the huge

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.280
task of translating documents by Arabs,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.640
Persians, and Greeks

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.240
as literally as possible from Arabic into Latin.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.680
An intellectual golden age followed,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.720
leading to the founding

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.800
of several universities during the Middle Ages.”

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.440
This isn't just about history.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.880
It's about how history is weaponized.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.360
Because that old story,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.360
the West, as the guardian of liberty

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.040
and the East,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.800
like Persia

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.200
as the eternal threat, is alive and well today.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.040
And representing

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.040
the West

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.520
is its most recent 70 year old invention.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.960
The settler colony called Israel.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.880
“It's a map of a curse.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.480
Iran's malignant arc”

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.560
“By standing up for your freedom

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.040
from an evil and oppressive regime.”

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.280
“God bless Israel and God bless America

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.080
Thank you very much.”

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.480
Athenian Greece was once

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.280
cast as the only democracy

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.000
in a sea of Persian tyranny.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.720
Now it's Israel,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.160
the only

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.120
democracy in the Middle East

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.360
against big, scary Iran.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.960
“So it's a tiny country, tiny, surrounded

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.200
well, shall we say,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.960
living in a very tough neighborhood.”

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.280
“Nuclear weapons.”

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.160
“Iran lied.”

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.400
Iran is still framed

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.000
as the looming irrational threat.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.080
Even when it's Israel that launched the war.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.120
“The people of Israel don't want this war.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.160
There is one force

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.840
putting your family in grave danger

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.040
the tyrants of Tehran.”

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.120
Western civilization

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.840
defines itself by reason, liberty, freedom.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.480
But these traditions were refined,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.720
if not born in the East.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.040
And the irony is ridiculous,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.040
because from the birth of this myth

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.960
all the way until today,

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.640
the West has repeatedly undermined liberty

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.360
and freedom,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.960
especially here.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.800
So when the West tells you who they are

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.400
and who their enemies are

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.360
ask who wrote the story

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.800
and who got written out.
