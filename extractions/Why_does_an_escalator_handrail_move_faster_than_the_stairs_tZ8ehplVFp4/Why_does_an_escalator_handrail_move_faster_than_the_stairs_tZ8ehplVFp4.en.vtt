00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:02.400
- On October 23rd, 2018,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.400
thousands of football
fans were making their way

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.920
to the game in Rome.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.440
Excitement for the game was high,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.160
and the fans began to chant and sing.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.600
At 7:03 pm,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.240
around 50 people were
riding the long escalator

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.800
down to the platform,
but within 30 seconds,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.520
the crowd had swelled
to nearly double that.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.800
Everything seemed fine,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.240
but inside the escalator was a problem.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.240
The weight of the passengers
was bearing down on the steps,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
and the load on the main
motor was increasing.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.880
To try to slow the descent,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.040
the motor applied a counter torque.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.800
But as the force continued to increase,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.440
the stairs began to move faster.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.080
By 7:04 pm, the crowd had tripled.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.000
The motor finally reached its limit,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.840
and under the massive strain,
the drum began to slip.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.360
With the motor losing control,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.240
the escalator triggered
its second line of defense.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.720
A safety relay tripped,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.960
immediately cutting power to the motor.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.360
The main brake clamped
down on the metal drum

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.280
to stop the descent of the stairs,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.920
but, it failed.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.160
The friction on the
main drum wasn't enough

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.840
to stop the motor from spinning,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.960
and the stairs continued to accelerate.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.880
Sensing the motor had
lost control of the steps,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.680
the escalator engaged
the last line of defense.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.560
In the event of an emergency,
an auxiliary break is designed

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.240
to bypass the motor entirely

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.520
and directly lock the drive shaft.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.200
Under normal circumstances,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.760
the chance that all three
safety measures fail

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.040
at the same time is vanishingly small.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.840
But these weren't normal circumstances.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.360
At 7:05 pm, the third and
final safety system failed,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.000
and the stairs began to plummet.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.360
Fans were flung forward

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.640
and started streaming down the escalator.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.280
Some lept over the central
barrier in desperation,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.240
while others were swept
into a crushing pileup.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.360
At the bottom, the landing
became a dangerous choke point.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.120
Under the pressure, the steps twisted

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.840
and buckled into jagged metal,
leaving 24 people injured.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.480
Something like this
shouldn't have been possible,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.840
and experts at the time knew
that something had gone wrong,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.080
and they started to suspect foul play.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.400
In the aftermath, Rome's Transit Agency

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.760
sealed off the accident site

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.880
and closed the Republica
station for several months.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.280
The authorities ordered both a technical

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.960
and a criminal investigation,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.880
and the mayor even publicly vowed

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.200
to discover the cause of the accident.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.000
So investigators began
dismantling the wreck,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.520
tearing it down piece by piece

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.240
to reconstruct what had happened.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.720
The ride people experienced
on that escalator

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.520
was one of the most terrifying
rides of their lives.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.000
But maybe it's more similar to the origin

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.920
of escalators than you might think.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.200
Like what was the first
escalator even used for?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.440
Do you wanna have a guess?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440
It was an attraction in a theme park

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.600
all the way back in 1896.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.800
It had no steps, a 25 degree incline,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.280
and it was essentially
just a slow conveyor belt

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.360
made of metal and wooden parts.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.760
It brought people up a full seven feet

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.440
before they would have to walk
downstairs on the other side,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.760
and it was a huge success.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.480
Over 75,000 people enjoyed the attraction

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.880
during its two week
stay at the Old Iron Pier

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.000
on Coney Island.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.720
The ride was named the Continuous Elevator

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.520
and its inventor, Jesse
Reno, had created it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.120
not just as an attraction,
but as a proof of concept,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.440
because he saw it as the
future of transportation.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.080
But as Reno watched
people ride his invention,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.160
he began to notice a pattern.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.360
Nobody walked.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.520
Instead, they stood still,
feet planted firmly sideways

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.360
with people gripping the handrail tightly.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.840
Two years later, the department
store Harrods in England

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.440
installed a similar device,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.920
but the ride was so
unsettling that Harrods

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.240
had to put staff at the
top to offer brandy to men

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.480
and smelling salts to women
just to calm their nerves.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.920
You see, for both devices,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.280
the 25 degree conveyor belt
was precarious to walk on

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280
and unnerving to stand on.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800
At around 12 degrees,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.880
walking on an incline becomes difficult,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.520
and 25 degrees is roughly the limit

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.160
that our ankles can flex.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.560
If only there was a way to
replace the conveyor belt

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.560
with a moving set of stairs.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.520
Well, then the riders would
always have a flat surface

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.160
to stand on and a
staircase they could climb

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.520
if they wanted to.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.400
One attempt at a solution
had already been around

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.000
for four decades, and it was
called the revolving stairs.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.720
It consisted of a chain
that went around a loop,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.600
then fixed stair shaped
blocks were attached to it,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.960
creating a flat surface to stand
on during the main incline.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.400
But as soon as you'd reached the top,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.920
the steps tilted forward, making
it treacherous to get off,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.120
and a similar problem
plagued you at the bottom.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.400
Now, you might think if the top

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.840
and bottom are causing problems,
just extend each landing,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.600
but that also doesn't work.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.720
You just end up with a
jagged mess for longer.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.080
So how do modern escalators
solve this problem?

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320
I mean, have you ever
stopped to think what happens

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.840
to the stairs at the top

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.000
of the escalator when they disappear?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.360
Clearly, we have steps going
around in some sort of loop,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.560
but how do they actually
behave on the return journey?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.320
What if I give you two options?

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.880
Do they stay right side up like the cabins

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.760
in a Ferris wheel, or
do they flip upside down

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.560
and then flip back
again at the other side?

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.560
- I'm gonna go this one all day.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.040
- Ferris wheel.
- This one makes more sense.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.840
- Ferris Wheel.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.040
- Yeah, this one.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.280
- I think they turn upside down.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.760
- And they're actually right side up.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.438
- I think I'm gonna go with this.

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:39.254
- Wow. You're both

00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:39.278
- They just keep-
- Yeah.

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:41.760
- The solution to this problem
came from another inventor

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.520
named George Wheeler.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.520
His idea forms the basis of
every escalator in use today.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.720
A modern version of it
works something like this.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.760
A typical subway escalator has
an electric motor at the top

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.640
with a power output of
around 50 kilowatts.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.040
Smaller than most electric cars.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.880
This motor spins extremely
fast at over a 1,000 RPM,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.400
but it's pretty weak.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.560
So to drive the steps, the escalator needs

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.000
to convert this into a slower
output with more force.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.440
To do this, it uses a reduction
gearbox in a gear system,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.760
lowering the output to just a few RPM

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.440
and increasing the torque
by a factor of around 100.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.560
The motor is connected
with a large sprocket

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.400
to a reinforced steel chain,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.480
which pulls the stairs around a loop.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.960
The so-called step chain
is fitted with wheels

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.080
to allow it to roll
smoothly around curves.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.640
But unlike the design
for the revolving stairs,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.200
Wheeler proposed attaching
each step to this chain

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.720
through a single axle, giving
it the freedom to rotate.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.920
Next, he added a second
set of wheels to each step

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.840
that followed a different track,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.680
allowing him to control the
angle of each step at any point.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.000
On the incline, the two tracks overlap

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.840
just like the revolving staircase,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.480
but then at the top,
the two tracks separate,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.920
and this is what allows us

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.040
to keep the steps level
throughout the entire ride.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.080
The tracks then remain
separated and curve around.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.840
The steps flip upside down,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.800
tuck into the loop, and
start their return journey.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.960
At the start of the
incline, the tracks rejoin

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.280
and the whole process repeats.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.200
- So the answer is, you are both wrong.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.625
- Oh my God.

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:21.198
- I don't want to be interviewed anymore.

00:07:21.198 --> 00:07:23.080
- Yeah.
- Wow. I never really thought about that.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.880
- Yeah, like, I would say,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.400
it's like a upside down elevator, bro.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.240
- Guess what? You're right.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.640
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.720
- But despite all modern escalators

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.960
adopting Wheeler's design, at the time,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.480
it caught so little attention

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.880
that he was forced to shelve the idea.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.520
It wasn't until eight years
later that another inventor,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.520
Charles Seeberger, bought his patent

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.920
and capitalized on the invention.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.480
Seeberger partnered with
the Otis Elevator Company,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.920
and together they built a prototype.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.440
A year later, in 1900,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.280
they showcased it at the
Paris Exposition Universelle.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.240
In total, 51 million people
flocked to the exposition

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.400
to see the marvels of modern technology.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.080
But one of the most popular exhibitions

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.040
was the world's first
true commercial escalator.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.200
The machine drew huge crowds.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.600
French historian Philippe
Jullian described it

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.840
as the jolliest attraction
at the exhibition

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.200
and wrote, "The escalator
caused many an incident worthy

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.200
"of the vaudeville, separating families,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.760
"sending old men sprawling,
delighting the children,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.160
"and reducing their nannies to despair."

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.960
The escalator was even awarded
one of the grand prizes

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.160
of the fair.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.560
Shortly after, escalators
started being installed

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.760
in different places across the world.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.320
But these escalators weren't perfect.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.160
They had smooth flat stairs,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.600
and when they reached the top,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.560
these stairs would disappear
under a wooden board,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.120
leaving a dangerous gap between them.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.680
Shoe laces, coats, and
especially the long skirts

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.200
in fashion at the time easily
got caught in the machinery.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.520
One incident even saw a three year girl

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.760
getting her foot pinched in the gap.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.400
And while the girl luckily
escaped with injured toes

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.720
and a missing shoe, something
in the design had to change.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.320
To solve this, Seeberger

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.040
and Otis installed a
triangular shunt at the end

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.000
of the escalator, forcing
rider to go off to the left

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.480
before they reached the dangerous gap.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.640
This system worked, but it was awkward

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.560
because it meant people
had to put one foot

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.120
onto solid ground while
the other was still moving,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.560
which became especially tricky

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.680
when some people stood
still and others walked.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.800
So to reduce the risk of people
getting in each other's way,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.360
operators asked people
to stand on the right

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.400
and keep the left lane
clear for faster walkers.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.400
It's a convention we still
often follow to this day,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.520
but as it turns out,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.200
there's a much better
solution than the shunt.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.560
Modern escalator steps aren't
smooth, they're grooved.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.480
These grooves then interlock perfectly

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.360
with a comb plate at the
top of the escalator.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.000
So now, if a small item
approaches the end,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.280
the comb plate lifts it
up and out of harm's way.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.520
This makes it much harder
for things to get stuck,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.880
and perhaps more importantly,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.600
it allows people to
safely step off forwards.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.320
But the comb plate doesn't
entirely solve the problem.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.880
We still have these gaps on
the side of the escalator

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.840
that can pinch and trap
objects as the steps move.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.960
So to address this,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.200
a new safety feature called
the skirt brush was added

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.360
to the escalator in 1982.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.400
Escalators are full of subtle
safety features like this,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.920
some old and some new,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.480
but almost all of them are
designed around people.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.280
All the way back in 1896,
Jesse Reno predicted

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.360
that riders on his attraction
would need something

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.720
to hold onto, so he
introduced a moving handrail.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.840
In a modern escalator, the
motor has a separate connection

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.440
to turn a friction wheel
that drives the handrail.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.560
The only problem is that
friction wears things down.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.960
So over time, the wheel gets smaller,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.280
and as its circumference decreases,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.320
each rotation moves the
rubber loop a slightly shorter

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.240
distance, so the handrail
begins to move more slowly.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.040
The effect is small, but
it builds up over time.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.240
So to compensate for this,
a new handrail is calibrated

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.600
to move around 2% faster than the steps.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.280
You can actually try this yourself.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.200
Next time you're standing on an escalator,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.480
just place your hand next
to you as you stand still,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.560
and you will watch as your
hand slowly drifts forward.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.720
This speed difference stops the handrail

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.760
from lagging too far
behind the steps over time.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.480
- Because I have definitely noticed that,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.400
that sometimes I'm on an escalator

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.880
and then it's going faster than me.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.560
My hand is going faster than my body,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.120
but that means it's a new escalator.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.880
- Well, it's a new frictional wheel.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.840
That wheel that drives the
hand, we don't replace,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.760
we don't replace the entire escalator.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.520
- Oh, wow, so that's like
a party trick I can use

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.640
to entertain my friends.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.720
I mean, I don't know when I'd
have a party on an escalator,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.360
but whatever, if I'm on an
escalator with my friends

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.200
and I can see it moving, I'd be like,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.360
"Hey, that's 'cause there's
a new frictional wheel."

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.440
I can tell them that and impress them.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.720
- But it's not just the handrail.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.040
The speed of the steps
themselves is also something

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.680
that needs to be carefully controlled.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.680
And modern escalators
use AC induction motors,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.600
which are extremely good at regulating

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.360
their rotational speed.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.080
And this has an unexpected
benefit on downward escalators.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.800
With enough people riding,
their weight is enough

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.680
that the motor no longer
has to power the ride.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.560
Instead, the weight of
the passengers themselves

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.280
drives the chain and
causes the motor to spin.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.320
As more people board, the
force on the motor increases,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.720
and it's pushed to turn faster.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.640
But modern AC induction motors work

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.800
by creating a rotating magnetic field.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.200
When the motor tries to
spin faster than the field,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200
electric currents are induced inside it,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.680
which then create their
own magnetic field.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.000
This new field pushes back
in the opposite direction

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.320
to the spin, creating a braking force,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.160
which resists the increase in speed.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.880
But something interesting
happens when the motor resists

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.840
like this, rather than consuming energy,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.440
the physics of the motor flips

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.760
and it uses the excess mechanical energy

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.840
to produce an electric current.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.600
This is called regenerative braking,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.840
and it's the same trick
that electric vehicles use

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.680
to recharge their batteries.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.720
In effect, the motor
turns into a generator.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.800
The result is that on a busy day,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.920
many modern downward escalators
aren't just moving people,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.400
they're actually generating electricity.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.360
Often this is channeled back
to the building's internal grid

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.200
and used to power other devices,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.880
including the upward escalators.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.080
- So even the escalator
that was invented

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.360
by George Wheeler

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.240
and was installed in 1920,
the Paris Exhibition,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.520
et cetera, I mean, all these
escalators were regenerators.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.080
- What?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.920
- Yeah, when there were people standing

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.400
on the escalator in down direction,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.840
these escalators were feeding
energy back into the grid.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.800
- No, it's like the down
escalator's a generator?

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.080
- This regenerative braking

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.880
makes escalators
extremely power efficient,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.920
but more importantly,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.480
it makes them inherently safe.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.280
But there is a point where
if you keep adding weight,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.280
then eventually the
force becomes so strong

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.600
that the motor can no longer resist it.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.800
And if left unchecked,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.600
it would start accelerating
uncontrollably.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.800
The stairs would go plummeting down,

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.920
which is exactly what happened in Rome.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.160
After a nearly two year
long investigation,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.520
the investigators published
this 86 page report.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.000
Inside it lists the
exact sequence of events

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.160
that led to the disaster.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.240
As fans crowded onto the escalator,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.280
their combined weight increased
the load on the main motor.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.040
The motor tried to resist this change,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.040
but as more and more people funneled on,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.720
the force got too high,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.480
and eventually it hit a tipping point

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.080
and the motor started
accelerating uncontrollably.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.040
Safety sensors in the machine
noticed this sudden change

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.440
and triggered two things
in short succession.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.160
At first, the power to the motor was cut,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.600
and immediately after that,
the main brake engaged.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.240
Two massive arms clamped down on the drum

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.680
to lock it in place and avert a runaway.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.040
This break should have
had enough stopping power

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.600
to bring the fully loaded
escalator to a halt,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.280
even under the massive
strain, but it didn't.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.880
Tests after the incident showed

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.720
that its braking force was
far too low, around 37%

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.920
of the manufacturer's specification.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.560
The weakened brake struggled
to slow the spinning motor

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.560
and the escalators downhill
acceleration continued.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.360
This is when the last
line of defense kicked in.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.240
When the escalator speed
rose by more than 20%,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.280
the auxiliary brake triggered
driving steel wedges

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.000
into a disc on the drive shaft.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.160
But when investigators
opened up this brake,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.520
they were shocked.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.440
The final mechanical backstop
had been partially disabled.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.240
Someone had physically tied plastic straps

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.800
around one of the two brake
wedges and rendered it useless.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.880
(dramatic music)
With half the system unable to engage,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.280
its stopping power was cut by 50%,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.240
just enough for the weight
of all those passengers

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.520
to overpower the brake

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.600
and render the last
line of defense useless.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.920
Investigators knew that these failures

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.680
should have been automatically recorded

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.360
in the error logs,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.040
but when they went to
check, they found nothing.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.120
The error codes had been turned off.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.040
Meaning critical malfunctions could occur

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.880
without leaving a trace.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.440
The only way this could happen
was if they had been disabled

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.400
on purpose, meaning someone
must have reprogrammed

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.480
the system to stop recording fault codes.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.240
Next investigators turn to
the maintenance records,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.800
but they found these similarly incomplete

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.800
and evidence of major
work on the escalator

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.320
was nowhere to be found at all.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.640
With all the main safety
systems compromised

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.720
and critical alerts turned off,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.760
the escalator had been
a ticking time bomb.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.680
All findings from the
technical investigation

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.240
pointed not to a manufacturing defect,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.760
but to a pattern of neglect

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.680
and falsification by those in charge

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.760
of keeping the machine safe.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.200
This left the prosecution
with one clear question,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.960
who was responsible?

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.320
The trail of evidence led back

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.360
to June, 2017 when
maintenance responsibilities

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.120
for Rome's escalators shifted

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.080
to a new contractor, Metro Roma.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.640
The Transit Authority
ATAC severed its contract

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.080
with Metro Roma in an attempt

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.240
to wash its hands of the situation.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.960
But as the criminal inquest
continued, it became clear

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.440
that the problem went far deeper.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.800
The investigators discovered

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.200
that Metro Roma had been
working hand in hand

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.360
with the Transit Authority ATAC,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.080
and together they presided
over negligent maintenance

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.280
and falsified records
all across the network.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.400
By September 2019, 11 suspects were named

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.200
and the courts had suspended
three ATAC managers

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.400
along with the chief of Metro Roma.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.120
The prosecution's findings were grave.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.160
In many cases,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.640
safety devices had been
deliberately sabotaged

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.880
to avoid escalator shutdowns,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.040
and those in charge had
covered their tracks

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.760
through a pattern of
fraud and obstruction.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.600
In the midst of the public outrage,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.920
prosecutors recorded a chilling wiretap

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.720
of ATAC Manager Renato Domico.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.880
The translation, "If you run the numbers,

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.360
"out of 700 escalators,
there'd be like three

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.920
"or four more dropping. Come on."

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.360
The prosecutors note in their report

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.080
that Domico appeared
uninterested in the possibility

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.040
there might have been people

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.440
on those three or four escalators.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.120
It was simply a matter of
numbers and percentages to him.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.160
It was a callous remark

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.200
and it painted a clear
picture of the incident.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.680
This wasn't an engineering
failure, it was a human one.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.600
But that brings us to a
more fundamental question.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.480
I mean, how safe are escalators really?

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.640
The truth is when they're
properly maintained,

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.280
the safety margins on
escalators are enormous.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.320
Each system is engineered
to handle forces far beyond

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.080
what they'll ever see in service.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.920
- So the breaking load

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.960
of our step is like greater
15 kilonewtons to 1.5 tons.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.427
So you can put an elephant on
the step and it won't break.

00:19:12.427 --> 00:19:16.720
Well, I've never seen a step
break in my work career.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.720
Never seen a step chain break either.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.200
I mean, it's does not happen.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.480
I mean, I'm not here to say
that there are no accidents

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.200
on an escalator, but the accidents I know,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.720
I mean, it's critical like that you,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.520
that you ensure the right maintenance.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.440
That's the most important thing,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.240
because in the end, it's
all about maintenance.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.440
- When this is done right,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.520
the chances of a catastrophic
failure are vanishingly small

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.640
and with around 1.5 million
escalators worldwide,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.880
that really is how it should be.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.640
In the US and Canada alone,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.200
over a hundred billion escalator trips

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.720
are happening every year,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.440
making the escalator one of
the most widely used forms

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.280
of transport on the planet.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.680
On a scale that large, it's sometimes easy

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.560
to point the finger at our
technology when things go wrong.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.760
But the truth is,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.000
no matter how well
designed our systems are,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.800
they all rely on people to maintain them.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.200
And perhaps that's the lesson here.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.880
As humans, we have a duty of
care, not just to ourselves,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.040
but to everyone around us.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.040
And sometimes that means
taking responsibility

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:33.680
for keeping each other safe.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:33.760
(gentle music)

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.640
In a way, that's how the
escalators story began

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.960
with one person deciding
to take responsibility

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.520
for a problem that everyone else ignored.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.320
Back when Jesse Reno was
at university, every day,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.720
he had to climb more than
300 steps to get to his frat house.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.640
But while everyone else
complained about this,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.480
Reno did something about it.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.840
He had the math, the science,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.000
and most importantly, the
problem solving skills

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.640
to create the world's
very first escalator,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.720
which he took to Coney Island.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.680
So how do you go from a
frustrating, everyday problem

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.000
to an innovation that changes the world?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.880
Well, that's where today's
sponsor, Brilliant, comes in.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.720
Brilliant is a learning app built

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.640
around interactive problem solving.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.800

circuits, probability,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.520
or even AI, Brilliant's
courses are designed

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.120
to help you build intuition,

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.080
the kind that helps you
see the world in new ways.

and build your understanding
from the ground up.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.840
This is actually my favorite
way to learn anything,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.600
getting hands-on with ideas

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.680
so that you actually understand them.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.720
Plus, it's been proven to be
up to six times more effective

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.800
than watching lecture videos.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.080
They're also releasing new

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.120
and updated courses across
math, science, coding, data,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.800
technology, you name it.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.520
