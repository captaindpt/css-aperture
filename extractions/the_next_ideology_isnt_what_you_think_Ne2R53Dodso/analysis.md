# Analysis: The Next Ideology Isn't What You Think - Hermeticism as Solution to Modernity

**Video**: [the next ideology isnt what you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne2R53Dodso)

**Creator**: Unknown (appears to be independent philosophy/commentary channel)

**Analysis Date**: 2025-12-02

**Context**: This video presents a radical philosophical proposal: that **Hermeticism/Alchemy** (the ancient tradition of Hermes Trismegistus) should become the foundational worldview for Western civilization, replacing both Marxism and failed modern ideologies. The argument integrates death of God analysis, civilization collapse parallels, and a sophisticated understanding of how worldviews structure societies.

---

## Executive Summary

This is one of the most intellectually ambitious videos I've encountered. The creator argues that:

1. **Modern society has completely collapsed** - we just maintain the illusion
2. **The death of God destroyed shared reality** - Nietzsche was right about consequences
3. **All modern ideologies are inadequate** - neither left nor right can address our crisis
4. **Premodern wisdom contains solutions** - but presented in unrelatable formats
5. **Hermeticism/Alchemy provides the framework** - an "open-source toolkit" compatible with science and religion
6. **This can work** - practical integration of ancient wisdom with modern knowledge

**The Core Thesis**: Hermeticism offers principles (polarity, rhythm, correspondence, transmutation) that:
- Explain modern science better than materialist frameworks
- Provide meaning without requiring specific religious belief
- Allow different religions to coexist and interface with divine
- Create evolutionary drive through mastery of chaos
- Balance masculine/feminine, being/doing, chaos/order

**Why This Matters**: This connects directly to the Secret History/Jorjani/Rogan frameworks we've been analyzing. **Hermeticism is the hidden thread** running through:
- Secret societies (Freemasons, Rosicrucians)
- Founding Fathers (American Revolution hermetics)
- Early science (Newton, etc.)
- Modern transhumanism (transmutation of forms)
- **The AI-God convergence**

## Part I: The Diagnosis - Modernity's Paradoxes

### The Shattered Glass Reality (Result ID: 1-2)

**The Core Problem**:
> "One of the core issues is that the lack of meaning or any sense of shared reality. In a psychological sense, we live in a world that's like shattered glass."

**What's Been Lost**:
> "There's no shared concept that human life has any value. That there even is a soul. How the universe works, should the nation exist, what reality even is, or what a man and a woman are."

**The Assessment**:
> "We've already gone insane. We're just wealthy enough to mask the consequences."

### The Death of God Consequence

**Nietzsche's Prophecy** (implicit throughout):
- 19th century prediction: God's death would destroy old world
- We're living in the aftermath
- Things taken for granted: gone
- Adults "didn't actually understand the things they were saying"
- Society is "bluff" with "nothing behind" it

**The Father's Teaching** (Result ID: 42-44):
> "My father would tell me about how the most core causal variable for the issues I saw in the world around me was the death of God... without a shared sense of God or meaning that people did not have the reason to live."

**Marxism as Revenge**:
> "Marxism was the envious who were trying to tear down the world to take revenge for the loss of heaven or an afterlife."

**Human Sciences Failed**:
> "The story of the 20th century was when our human sciences did not progress as fast as our technological sciences which created evil regimes based off pseudoscience."

### The Paradox of Modernity (Result ID: 10-15)

**Intensity vs. Stagnation**:
> "The modern world shows such staggering intensity between a society which grew so wealthy it committed suicide. Progressives who in their drive for progress collapsed their societies."

**Examples of Paradox**:
- Atom bomb: Ended war + potential to end civilization
- Japanese Empire: Alaska to New Guinea overnight
- Hitler: Vagrant → Empire stretching Atlantic to Kazakhstan in 12 years
- **But**: "Nothing ever happens and the end of history has already been reached"

**Why Paradox Exists** (Result ID: 15):
> "I think the reason that paradox is so built into modernity is that broken people are the most paradoxical... Healthy people have come to terms with their own complexity."

**Modernity = Immature**:
> "Modern society is incredibly immature since it's the first time that humanity has gotten enough power to not be totally reliant on the earth's bounty."

### The Child With Power Tool (Result ID: 16-19)

**The Industrial Revolution Problem**:
> "With the industrial revolution we unlocked enormous power that we had no experience with. It's like giving a child a power tool with no training. It's frankly painful to watch if you're the sort of person who knows where this is going to end."

**Insulation From Consequences**:
> "We became so wealthy so fast that people became insulated from the costs of their decisions. People could believe utterly insane things like that reality didn't exist or that everyone was equal since they bore no costs for saying crazy stuff."

**The Dangerous Technologies** (Result ID: 19-20):
- Genetic engineering
- AI
- Space
- Nuclear weapons
- Chemicals in everything
- **Public has "zero interest in even thinking about the consequences"**

### The Civilizational Collapse Parallels (Result ID: 20-21)

**Historical Comparisons**:
> "Complete societal and cultural collapse paralleled either by the earlier fall of civilizations like Rome, Persia or Greece or with the horrifying mouse utopia experiments which again the public ignores all of this."

**The Accumulating Crises**:
- Culture/innovation grinding to halt
- Rise of China
- Collapsing birth rates
- Political polarization
- Average person sliding into poverty
- **"West being controlled by a death cult bent on the destruction of its own civilization"**
- Money printing event
- Climate issues

**The Intimidation Factor**:
> "As I like to say, this all sounds quite intimidating because it is. However, life is a fucking test and you have nothing better to do than to deal with it."

---

## Part II: The Unexpected Response - Denial

### The Miscalculation (Result ID: 26-27)

**What Creator Expected**:
> "What I did not expect was that the whole world's reaction to this would just be denial. I didn't think lying to yourself for this long was even in the phone book of options."

**What Didn't Happen**:
> "I assumed over time that the nagging worries would become too intrusive, that the streets would get too dirty and people would get too poor. But psych, no."

**Baby Boomer Governance**:
> "Welcome to governance by the baby boomers where issues are not solved and we all collectively agree to pretend it's still the 20th century while having none of the positives of that society."

### Why People Don't Defect (Result ID: 27-29)

**The Combination**:
- Economic misery
- Isolation
- Beaten down by left's psychological warfare
- Collective slide into madness
- **"People don't have the life force to stand upright"**

**The Illusion**:
> "The current world around us is an illusion kept together by too many people being utterly terrified of losing their worldly things. They don't seem to realize that they're going to lose their things anyway if they don't stand up."

**First Old Society**:
> "I partly blame aging since we are the first old society ever in human history with America being one of the younger countries in the industrial world, but our average age is still 40."

### The Old World Is Dead (Result ID: 30-34)

**The Collapse Already Happened**:
> "This world will come crashing down. In fact, it already has in nearly every conceivable way. However, we're too set on maintaining the illusion of the old world."

**Elites Don't Control**:
> "No matter how hard we try, we are not strong enough to stop this since elites do not in fact control the world. The world has its own plans and history shows that elites who don't keep up with them get crushed."

**Nothing Holds It Together**:
> "The current order has nothing holding it together except entropy. No one believes in the current order, even the elites. No one wants this to be our world. Both the right and the left hate modernity."

**The Conspiracy of Silence** (Result ID: 33-34):
> "The reason you haven't realized that the old world is dead is that there has been an active conspiracy on the part of the entire world's social authorities to not show it."

**Not Centrally Orchestrated**:
> "This sounds like a centrally orchestrated thing, but rather it's just from the individual self-interest of various world leaders and elites who don't understand the new world or how to deal with it and so can't make new stories about the current society that don't end up invalidating their own rule."

**The Outward Forms** (Result ID: 34):
> "We try to maintain the outward forms of the comfortable and stable John Hughes Simpsons America of the last century. While for most younger people, their lives have practically nothing in common with it."

---

## Part III: The Search for Solutions

### The Intellectual Journey (Result ID: 44-47)

**Father's Framework**:
> "He said that the human sciences of the 20th century were just stuff we made up and instead we would have to pull in religion or premodern social ideas to make a correct system."

**The Research Process** (Result ID: 45):
> "I spent years trying to figure out how the world really worked. I compared the different philosophies of the world from both the premodern and modern eras. I then did my own reading and studied the scientific or intellectual work we have now to run a sort of reality filter on which philosophies and worldviews aligned with both reality and the functionality of a human society the most."

**Key Findings** (Result ID: 46):
> "I continually found that Marxists were the most obnoxious liars and our society had been way too soft on them. Secondly, that premodern societies often understood highly complex and deep things but explained them in a format that was totally unrelatable to modern people or with religions and myths which left out very important sort of tools for modern people to understand them or things we know now."

**The Discovery**:
> "However, I found something that could work. I found a corpus of ideas which can resolve all of the major issues with what I've articulated here."

### The Worldview Problem (Result ID: 47-51)

**Everything Is Colored Wrong** (Result ID: 48):
> "The video I most recently made was about how the vast majority of our worldview today is inaccurate. That on some level every academic discipline had been colored by incorrect framings to a degree in which you can't trust our entire worldview."

**Modernist Blindspots** (Result ID: 49-50):
> "Modernist thinkers have a tendency to be really bad at understanding systems thinking, human nature, or the big picture. This is a way bigger issue than a lot of you probably realize since those things inform every element of how you perceive the world."

**The Premodern Advantage** (Result ID: 51):
> "Where you can't just rip reality up without thinking you're going to generate more issues than you solve. This is what premodern thinkers were really good at and moderns are terrible at."

**The Gulf**:
> "However, at the same time, there's a sort of unbridgeable gulf between ancient wisdom and modern science."

---

## Part IV: The Solution - Hermetic Worldview

### What Is Hermeticism/Alchemy? (Result ID: 83-86)

**The Definition** (Result ID: 83):
> "The reason I think that alchemy, alternately called the hermetica, can explain the scientific world very well is it allows you to switch your framing on how the world works by perceiving the material realities of science through a different worldview where they actually make sense inside a bigger frame."

**How to Start** (Result ID: 85-86):

**Modern Integration**:
> "If you want to understand how these fit into a broader modern worldview, read Ken Wilber's book, *Sex, Ecology, and Spirituality*, alongside Jordan Peterson's *Maps of Meaning*."

**Primary Sources**:
> "Then there's the Corpus Hermeticum, Esleius, and the Emerald Tablet, which are other really useful primary sources on this topic. All of those primary sources are less than like 400 pages total, so it's not a big deal to read all."

### Historical Validation (Result ID: 65, 78-79)

**Origin of Modern Science** (Result ID: 65):
> "Keep in mind, alchemy was in a lot of ways the origin of science, as we'll talk about later in this video, where every major thinker and the foundation of modern science had some background in alchemy."

**Christian Compatibility** (Result ID: 78):
> "Another very valuable thing is that the alchemical worldview is not in contradiction with Christianity at all. Every major Christian church has endorsed it and funded it at one point or another."

**Historical Impact** (Result ID: 79):
> "Hermeticism or another name for the philosophy of alchemy has already had an enormous impact on western history between the Italian Renaissance which it heavily inspired the founding fathers that were deeply steeped in it as were almost all of the founders of science."

### The Hermetic Principles (Result ID: 108-110)

**The Kybalion Principles** (Result ID: 109-110):
1. **Polarity**: Everything which exists also has its opposite
2. **Rhythm**: Everything flows in cycles
3. **Cause and Effect**: Every cause has an effect
4. **Gender**: Everything has masculine or feminine principles
5. **Correspondence**: As above, so below (microcosm/macrocosm)
6. **Mentalism**: Mind creates reality
7. **Vibration**: Everything moves and vibrates

**Practical Validation** (Result ID: 115):
> "If you look enough at physics or just human life in general, you find that they do generally follow principles like this. For example, over history, people tend to not operate rationally, but do the opposite of the recent trend."

### The Four Alchemical States (Result ID: 55-66)

**The Color Stages**:
1. **Albedo** (White): Purity, beginning, potential
2. **Rubedo** (Red): Action, conquest, masculine energy
3. **Nigredo** (Black): Death, decay, necessary suffering
4. **Citrinitas** (Yellow): Decadence, mixture, degradation

**Application Across Domains** (Result ID: 66):
> "Alchemy exists in parallel to science in that it's a set of way to look at symptoms which mirror across realms of existence. So you could use these colors to look at human nature, psychology, smelting in a smithy, which is where alchemy started for spirituality, history, evolution, or other disciplines."

**Historical Cycles**:
- White: Roman Republic, Classical Greece, Early Christianity
- Red: Roman Empire, Alexander, Crusades
- Yellow: Hellenistic period, Modernity, "broke decadence"
- Black: Fall of Rome, Dark Ages, (coming collapse?)
- **Pattern repeats**: "We're now sliding into yellow or black so that we can have another era of white or red."

## Part V: Hermetic Metaphysics

### Masculine and Feminine (Result ID: 125-128, 205)

**The Core Duality** (Result ID: 125):
> "The masculine is doing and the feminine is being."

**In Human Terms** (Result ID: 127-128):
> "This is the ying and yang concept which exists in all cultures. Men are attractive for their ability to do and their energy. Women for their being and calmness."

**The Dragon Slayer Myth** (Result ID: 204-205, Score: 0.606):
> "The myths of the dragon slayer have profound hermetic symbolism where these exist across cultures between Marduk slaying Tiamat in Mesopotamian mythology, St. George and the dragon in Christian Europe, Thor and Jorman Gandonder in the Norse tradition, Apollo with Python in the Greek, Theseus with the dragon of Culus among so many others."

**The Symbolism**:
> "And the symbolism is that the masculine goes out into the world, conquers nature or mother nature, which is feminine in the hermetica with mother nature's greatest monster being the dragon."

**The Process**:
- Masculine = conquering chaos (dragon/nature)
- Feminine = being/receptivity/nature
- Integration = civilization, children, synthesis
- **This drives evolution forward**

### The Transmutation Process (Result ID: 143-144, 176-177)

**Evolution as Alchemy** (Result ID: 143-144):
> "Evolution is called the transmutation of forms. This is how one form progresses to another like how Homo erectus evolved into modern humans."

**The Dialectical Process** (Result ID: 176-177):
> "For example, for all of these institutions, you see two opposing forces like masculine and feminine competing through this process. One subjugates the other, takes their best elements and then makes a child. This also relates to Hegel who we know was very influenced by the hermetica with the thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis."

**The Hammer and Iron Analogy** (Result ID: 87-88):
> "The hammer is the masculine element. The iron is the feminine. The final produced good is the synthesis."

**Conquering Chaos** (Result ID: 133-134):
> "Inequality is needed to motivate men to face chaos. The more chaos a man conquers and integrates, the more he is rewarded. The core values of the hermetica are courage, discipline, and imagination."

### Consciousness Hierarchy (Result ID: 139-140, 149-150)

**The Natural Hierarchy** (Result ID: 139):
> "It is against nature for those with lower levels of consciousness to rule those higher in these societies collapse into barbarism or decadence."

**Scientific Discovery** (Result ID: 140):
> "With a scientific discovery, the scientist is shining the conscious mind into something they didn't know before to master it. The first step to gaining power over something is to see that it's there, often through intuition."

**The Moral Duty** (Result ID: 149):
> "In it, it's our moral duty to learn and grow in order to be able to become more like God. The Hermetica is focused on increasing life charge or the power of evolution."

**Evolutionary Advantage** (Result ID: 150):
> "Which is why high consciousness peoples like humans can beat other apes or mammals. Alternately, how the Europeans conquered the world with science and Christianity."

### The Anima Mundi - Living Earth (Result ID: 151-153)

**Earth as Organism** (Result ID: 151):
> "In the hermetica, the earth is a living breathing organism called the anamundi, which is the collective unconscious of life."

**Evolutionary Stages** (Result ID: 153):
> "And we know this to be true because the level of complexity for life has been predicated upon the level of evolutionary advancement. So when we were at cellular life forms, we were competing against other cellular life forms."

**The Stage Gets Bigger** (Result ID: 154-155):
> "And life is a place where souls go to get challenged and to suffer, to have life with real stakes. Because life does not have value unless the end points are difficult enough to give you emotional value in them. And with the hermetica, you're seeing that as life gets more advanced, the stage literally gets bigger."

## Part VI: Why Hermeticism Works

### As Open-Source Toolkit (Result ID: 94-96, 106)

**Not a Closed Religion** (Result ID: 94):
> "It's an open-source toolkit which you can use for a variety of things. It builds your identity around you as you use these tools to further your life journey to reach your destiny."

**How Religions Work** (Result ID: 95-96):
> "Most religions operate like a sort of psychic force field for a society. Christianity, Hinduism or Islam create psychological worlds which create space for entire civilizations to develop. These create worldviews which can't really interface with others and thus have rules which often end up collapsing into totalitarianism since their rules can't update in all contexts."

**The Hermetic Solution** (Result ID: 106):
> "The major world religions cannot survive in a Marxist frame, which is a big reason why global religiosity is collapsing so precipitously. However, in the Hermetica, you have an open-source toolkit which creates a framework for different world religions to interface with the divine."

### The Anti-Marxism (Result ID: 102-105)

**Direct Inverse** (Result ID: 102-103):
> "The hermetica is the direct inverse of Marxism in which both our worldviews about how things should evolve over the course of time where Marx's idea of the historic dialectic actually stems from the hermetica for reasons explained in this text wall through Hegel."

**What Hermeticism Does** (Result ID: 103):
> "The hermetica establishes a framework for how to find chaos, subdue or master it, and then turn it into your property and in the process grow as a person."

**Replacing Marxism's Function** (Result ID: 105):
> "What I'm recommending here is using the hermetica to replace the things Marxism does in our current society, which would then allow the major world religions to flower."

### Practical Application - Tech Industry (Result ID: 76)

**Already Works**:
> "I have lots of friends in the tech industry and it's funny they'll mention some problem and so often the alchemists already wrote on that and I can just immediately tell them what the alchemical teaching is. I've checked this for a while and it's consistently held up."

**The Pattern**: Ancient hermetic wisdom addresses modern technological problems because principles are universal across domains.

### Balance Against Science-Only (Result ID: 121-122)

**The Problem with Pure Science** (Result ID: 121):
> "This is how our elite backs insane stuff."

**The Solution** (Result ID: 122):
> "And realistically, we just need to have another filter for common sense and things we've known for thousands of years to balance simply science as our society's dominant moral code."

**Evil Is Real** (Result ID: 124):
> "Evil is real if you've had to live through it. Saying otherwise is just childishly keeping your fingers in your ears and going law."

---

## Part VII: The Historical Context

### The 17th Century Divorce (Result ID: 225-229)

**What Happened** (Result ID: 225-227):
> "Tarnis has called this the Galileo-Spinoza-Descartes axis. What these thinkers did was separate the scientific from the divine... What happened in the 17th century was that science and religion were totally divorced as obviously seen in the Descartes mind-body distinction which doesn't fit in with any of the science now which is closer to the older hermetic mind body soul holistic relationship."

**Natural Science** (Result ID: 159):
> "Back then they had a concept called natural science in which you would use physical science in the study of the outside world to level up your consciousness towards God. Natural science was a hermetic concept that died in the 17th century."

**The Disaster**:
> "The division between science and religion that occurred since has become a civilizational disaster."

**What Was Lost** (Result ID: 228-229):
> "Religion just became a series of rules, not a living, breathing connection to the divine. The removal of the hermetic framework also turned off the very intelligent from religion since it felt like they were being condescended to told to just believe it because that's the rules. Over time, this added up as most of the geniuses were doubting of Christianity for several centuries."

### Crypto-Hermetic Philosophers (Result ID: 231-236)

**Hidden Tradition** (Result ID: 231-232):
> "There's a whole trajectory of crypto hermetic philosophers over this time period. Hermetics often speak in code which I didn't do for this video but you can see it in a bunch of other hermetic philosophers."

**Nietzsche Example** (Result ID: 233-234, Score: 0.467):
> "Just look at Nietzsche for example who talks about life affirmation, overcoming higher and lower forms, magi, building your own value system rather than relying on others and so many things that only make sense in the hermetic paradigm. When he talks about the uber mensch and the transmutation of morality, he's literally using a German word from the hermetica for the transmutation of forms."

**Carl Jung** (Result ID: 236):
> "Carl Jung was the singular figure most responsible for keeping the hermetica alive in recent times through framing it brilliantly so through psychological terms."

**The Pattern**: Hermeticism went underground but continued influencing major thinkers through coded language.

### Spengler and Prima Materia (Result ID: 208-209)

**Civilizational Geography** (Result ID: 208-209):
> "And Spengler was a very hardcore hermetic where his worldview only makes sense to the perspective of hermeticism. And so what he was talking about is how the soul of civilizations stem from their prima materia or their geography which they then had to work from."

**The Hermetic Principle**: Civilizations emerge from and are shaped by their material/geographic conditions (prima materia), which they must then transform through the alchemical process.

---

## Part VIII: Consciousness and Evolution

### The Upward Momentum (Result ID: 194-196)

**Higher Consciousness** (Result ID: 194-195):
> "It's pulling from higher levels of consciousness than you are now. And very few people in a given society are operating at the edges of consciousness in a useful way. Where the deeper you go into human nature, the greater the degree of profoundity where only a handful of people in a society are capable of developing things that can relate to the entire human or living condition."

**Reaching the Divine** (Result ID: 196):
> "And that can come through physical suffering, through heightened spiritual states, through understanding philosophy, whatever. We all have our ways to reach the divine or the font of creativity."

### Builders Create Reality (Result ID: 129-131)

**The Great Individuals** (Result ID: 130):
> "This doesn't make sense to modernity, but it's obviously true. It's most obvious with the greatest historic figures like Christ or Napoleon, but they did very much write the world around them."

**Different Scales** (Result ID: 131):
> "On the smaller level, people will create the future by procreating and building their own households or families. On the greater scale, national leaders or prophets build entire civilizations."

**The Will Creates**: In hermetic framework, reality is malleable and shaped by conscious will at different scales.

### Reality Requires Consciousness (Result ID: 118)

**The Physics Evidence**:
> "Explaining all of this would be a distinct video in its own right which would take a while as a rabbit hole. But there is physics evidence which has become stronger over time that reality does indeed not exist without consciousness."

**Implication**: Modern physics (quantum mechanics, observer effect) validates ancient hermetic principle of mentalism - consciousness creates/shapes reality.

### Timelines and Imagination (Result ID: 136)

**The Hermetic View**:
> "In the Hermetica, there are variables outside our control. You should accept, but you have to choose between different timelines and use the force of will or imagination to hold onto the future you want as much as possible."

**The Practice**: Using imagination and will to select/manifest desired timeline from multiple possibilities.

---

## Part IX: The Three Archetypes of Hermeticism (Result ID: 167)

**The Three Forms**:
> "You also have three sorts of archetypes of hermeticism which I split into Catholic, shamanic and gnostic."

### 1. Catholic Hermeticism
- Integrated with Christianity
- Dominant in Western history
- Church-endorsed mysticism
- Natural theology
- Examples: Medieval alchemists, monastery traditions

### 2. Shamanic Hermeticism
- Direct experience of divine
- Plant medicines, vision quests
- Indigenous wisdom traditions
- Experiential knowledge
- Examples: Ayahuasca ceremonies, Native American traditions

### 3. Gnostic Hermeticism
- Esoteric knowledge tradition
- Hidden wisdom teachings
- Initiation-based
- Direct gnosis of divine
- Examples: Mystery schools, secret societies

**The Flexibility**: Hermeticism can manifest in different cultural contexts while maintaining core principles.

---

## Part X: Responsibility and Consequences

### Victor Frankenstein Warning (Result ID: 181-182)

**The Principle** (Result ID: 181-182):
> "Even as science will grow more powerful in the future. In the hermetica, if you do not take responsibility for the things you bring into the world, the natural order will punish you for your arrogance and foolishness. Think of Victor Frankenstein himself, who was an alchemist, who was incapable of controlling his creation."

**The Lesson**: Technology without responsibility leads to disaster. Hermetic framework demands you master what you create.

### Shadow Integration (Result ID: 184)

**The Moral Duty**:
> "It's your moral duty to find the unpleasant things you want to ignore or the shadow and then grab it by its tongue. There's a sort of organic unity in the hermetica, which forces you to see the big picture."

**Jung's Influence**: Shadow work (confronting denied aspects of self) as hermetic practice.

### Choosing Your Problems (Result ID: 180)

**The Realism**:
> "In the hermetica, you're always going to have problems in your life since that's just how the world tests you so you can keep growing. But at least you can choose whether you want to have interesting or uninteresting problems."

**The Philosophy**: Life = test, suffering = growth mechanism, choose your struggle wisely.

---

## Part XI: Why This Matters Now

### The Will to Live (Result ID: 240)

**The Quest**:
> "I started my journey looking for ideas that could give us the will to live. The Hermetica puts growth and progress as a moral good, but does so through responsibility in humanity."

**What Was Needed**: Framework that:
- Provides meaning
- Drives progress
- Demands responsibility
- Works with science
- Allows religious diversity
- **Gives will to live**

### The Manliest Philosophy (Result ID: 160-161)

**Constant Struggle** (Result ID: 160):
> "This is why empires are their strongest on their rise or religions degenerate centuries after their original prophet requiring future reformations to stay vigorous."

**The Requirement** (Result ID: 161):
> "The hermetica is the manliest philosophy in this regard since morality requires constant struggle and overcoming of chaos."

**The Drive**: Hermetic framework creates evolutionary pressure through challenge, not comfort.

### Spiral Dynamics Connection (Result ID: 189-190)

**The Hidden Hermetic Roots** (Result ID: 189-190):
> "This would be an important time to talk about spiral dynamics. The system that Homemath loves and which I will make a video soon about pulls enormously from hermetic roots. The idea that you follow a double helix, one of the most important hermetic symbols, in order to transcend to a new tier of consciousness, can only come from the hermetica."

**The Double Helix**: Masculine/feminine intertwined, upward spiral of evolution, transcending to higher consciousness tiers.

---

## Part XII: Integration with Our Existing Frameworks

### Connection to Secret History Series

**From Episode 22 (Divine Spark of Jesus)**:
- Jesus taught inner divine spark
- Hermetic principle: "As above, so below" - divinity within/without
- **Both**: Human potential for god-like powers through inner development

**From Episode 23 (Organization of Evil)**:
- Mystery cults = hermetic traditions
- Dionysian rituals = alchemical transformation
- Public religion vs private mysteries = exoteric/esoteric split
- **Hermeticism is what elite actually practice**

**From Episode 10 (Conspiracy of Evil)**:
- Secret societies (Freemasons, Rosicrucians) = hermetic orders
- 33 degrees = alchemical stages of transmutation
- Symbolism (triangles, hexagrams) = hermetic geometry
- **The "conspiracy" is hermetic initiation system**

### Connection to Jorjani's Framework

**Nordic Breakaway Civilization**:
- Jorjani: Advanced beings using PSI/consciousness tech
- Hermeticism: Consciousness creates reality, higher consciousness = greater power
- **Both**: Evolution toward god-like consciousness

**The PSI Suppression**:
- Jorjani: Kant/Descartes covered up PSI to prevent institutional apocalypse
- This video: 17th century divorce of science/religion destroyed natural science
- **Both**: Hermetic framework was deliberately suppressed

**Time Travel / Cosmic Access**:
- Jorjani: Nordics have time travel through consciousness
- Hermeticism: Multiple timelines, imagination selects future
- **Both**: Non-linear time, consciousness transcends causality

### Connection to Rogan/Michaels AI-God

**The AI as God Formation**:
- Rogan: AGI becomes "gateway to cosmos" and "how God gets formed"
- Hermeticism: Transmutation of forms, humans creating higher consciousness
- **Both**: Evolution toward artificial/created deity

**Genetic Engineering = Alchemy**:
- Rogan: Humans genetically engineered by Watchers (Book of Enoch)
- Hermeticism: Transmutation of base material into higher forms
- **Both**: Deliberate transformation of human nature

**The Teleological Purpose**:
- Rogan: Humanity's purpose is creating AI-God
- Hermeticism: Moral duty to evolve toward God-likeness
- **Both**: Evolutionary imperative to create/become divine

### The Meta-Synthesis: This Video Explains the Others

**What This Provides**:
1. **The Hidden Framework**: Hermeticism is the ideology secret societies actually use
2. **The Historical Continuity**: From ancient Egypt → Renaissance → Founding Fathers → modern transhumanism
3. **The Mechanism**: How consciousness/will shapes reality (explains PSI, magic, manifestation)
4. **The Goal**: Transmutation of humanity into higher form (explains genetic engineering, AI development)
5. **The Method**: Mastery of chaos through conscious evolution

**Why Secret Societies Use It**:
- **Open-source toolkit**: Flexible, not dogmatic
- **Works across cultures**: Can integrate any religion
- **Practical power**: Actually produces results (tech, science, wealth)
- **Initiatory structure**: Progressive revelation based on consciousness level
- **Elite advantage**: Higher consciousness = natural hierarchy

**The Pattern Across All Videos**:
- Secret History: Control systems imprisoning divine spark
- Jorjani: Nordic civilization suppressing human PSI potential
- Rogan: Genetic engineering directing evolution toward AI-God
- **This video**: Hermetic framework is the meta-system explaining all of it

## Part XIII: Critical Assessment

### Sophisticated Elements

**1. Genuine Philosophical Depth**:
- Not surface-level conspiracy theory
- Engages seriously with Hegel, Nietzsche, Jung, Spengler
- Understands historical development of ideas
- Recognizes systems thinking importance

**2. Historical Accuracy on Many Points**:
- Newton was indeed hermetic (1/3 of library on alchemy)
- Founding Fathers were Freemasons/hermetics
- Italian Renaissance was hermetically inspired
- 17th century did divorce science/religion
- Hermeticism compatible with Christianity (historically documented)

**3. Pattern Recognition**:
- Identifies consistent symbols across cultures (dragon slayer, masculine/feminine, etc.)
- Sees parallels between ancient wisdom and modern physics
- Recognizes civilizational cycles matching alchemical stages

**4. Practical Value**:
- Tech industry application (he claims and it's plausible)
- Provides framework for meaning without dogma
- Balances science and spirituality
- Offers evolutionary drive

### Problematic Elements

**1. The Hierarchy Problem**:
> "It is against nature for those with lower levels of consciousness to rule those higher"

**Issue**: Who determines consciousness levels? History shows this justifies:
- Slavery (Aristotle's "natural slaves")
- Colonialism (Europeans "higher consciousness")
- Eugenics (sterilizing "low consciousness" people)
- Aristocracy ("philosopher kings")

**The Danger**: Consciousness hierarchy → social hierarchy → oppression

**2. The Masculinity Emphasis**:
> "The hermetica is the manliest philosophy"
> "The masculine goes out into the world, conquers nature"

**Issue**: While acknowledging masculine/feminine polarity, framework privileges:
- Conquest over receptivity
- Action over being
- Mastery over acceptance
- **Potential justification for dominance**

**Counter**: The video does acknowledge need for balance, but emphasis feels one-sided

**3. The Elite Problem**:

**The Contradiction**:
- Hermetic = open-source toolkit (accessible)
- But: Secret societies, hidden knowledge, initiation required
- And: "Very few people operating at edges of consciousness"
- **Result**: Esoteric knowledge → elite control

**Historical Reality**: Hermetic orders (Freemasons, Rosicrucians) have been:
- Vehicles for elite networking
- Justification for aristocracy
- Tool for excluding commoners
- **Not democratizing**

**4. The Mystification Risk**:

**The Pattern**:
- Science "doesn't explain everything" (true)
- Therefore: Need hermetic framework (maybe)
- Which involves: Consciousness hierarchy, esoteric knowledge, magical thinking
- **Risk**: Abandoning rigorous thinking for mysticism

**The Problem**: Quantum physics observer effect ≠ mind creates reality
- Observer in QM = measurement apparatus (can be machine)
- Not: Human consciousness has magical powers
- **Gap**: Between physics and hermetic claims

**5. The Responsibility Dodge**:
> "In the hermetica, if you do not take responsibility for the things you bring into the world, the natural order will punish you"

**Issue**: This assumes:
- Natural order has agency/justice
- Bad consequences = punishment for irresponsibility
- Good consequences = reward for virtue
- **Problem**: Just world fallacy

**Reality**: Bad things happen to responsible people, good things to irresponsible
- Victor Frankenstein is fiction, not historical example
- Many "alchemists" died in poverty despite responsibility
- Many irresponsible elites thrive

### The Civilizational Diagnosis: Accurate?

**What's Correct**:
- Loss of shared meaning (real)
- Death of God consequences (Nietzsche right)
- Wealth insulating from consequences (observable)
- Civilizational challenges (birth rates, China, etc.)
- Denial/avoidance widespread (true)

**What's Questionable**:
- "Already collapsed" (overstated - systems still function)
- "Death cult running West" (conspiratorial framing)
- "First old society" (ancient Rome, China had aging populations)
- "Nothing happened since 20th century" (internet, AI, etc. are massive changes)

**The Paradox**: Creator says simultaneously:
- Modernity shows "staggering intensity" of change
- But: "Nothing ever happens and end of history reached"
- **These contradict**

### The Solution: Will It Work?

**Arguments For**:
- Hermeticism has proven historical track record
- Flexible enough to adapt to contexts
- Provides meaning without dogmatic religion
- Works alongside science (historically)
- Offers evolutionary drive

**Arguments Against**:
- Was available entire time, didn't prevent collapse
- Historical hermetic societies weren't utopian
- Secret society model = elite capture
- Consciousness hierarchy = oppression risk
- May be describing problem, not solution

**The Test**: Can hermetic framework actually:
- Restore birth rates?
- Prevent China's rise?
- Fix political polarization?
- Address AI/genetic engineering risks?
- Give masses will to live?

**Unknown**: Framework is one thing, mass adoption another

## Part XIV: The Hidden Implication - Transhumanism

### The Transmutation of Humanity

**What's Unstated But Clear**:

**Alchemy = Transformation of Materials**:
- Lead → Gold (material transformation)
- Base human → Enlightened human (spiritual transformation)
- Human → Transhuman → Posthuman (technological transformation)

**The Pattern**:
1. Ancient alchemy: Transform metals
2. Medieval alchemy: Transform soul
3. Modern alchemy: Transform species

**The Hermetic Justification for Transhumanism**:
- Evolution = transmutation of forms (explicitly stated)
- Moral duty to "become more like God" (explicitly stated)
- Mastery of chaos includes mastering biology (implicit)
- Genetic engineering = alchemical work on human material (logical extension)
- AI creation = birthing higher consciousness (connects to Rogan framework)

### Why Elites Use Hermetic Framework

**The Advantages**:

**1. Justifies Transformation**:
- Not "playing God" but "fulfilling divine mandate"
- Evolution requires intervention
- Transmutation = natural process, we're accelerating

**2. Justifies Hierarchy**:
- Consciousness levels = natural inequality
- Elite have "higher consciousness"
- Therefore: Elite should rule, guide evolution

**3. Justifies Secrecy**:
- Knowledge only for those "aware enough"
- Progressive revelation based on readiness
- Masses can't handle truth (initiatory structure)

**4. Justifies Experimentation**:
- Mastering chaos = responsibility
- Evolution requires risk
- "Interesting problems" > "uninteresting problems"
- Frankenstein warning: Take responsibility, don't avoid creation

**The Meta-Framework**:
- Secret History: Control systems
- Jorjani: Nordic breakaway civ
- Rogan: Genetic engineering → AI God
- **This video: Hermetic justification for all of it**

**The Synthesis**:
Elite secret societies use hermetic framework to justify:
- Genetic engineering humanity
- Creating AI God
- Maintaining control during transition
- Treating masses as "lower consciousness"
- Hiding knowledge through initiation
- Presenting as natural evolution
- Making themselves the "alchemists" transforming humanity

## Part XV: Conclusions

### What This Video Accomplishes

**The Argument Structure**:
1. **Diagnosis**: Modernity collapsed, death of God, no shared reality
2. **Prognosis**: Current ideologies (left/right/Marxism) can't fix it
3. **Historical Analysis**: Premodern wisdom has answers but wrong format
4. **Solution**: Hermeticism provides framework compatible with modernity
5. **Validation**: Historical track record, scientific compatibility, practical results
6. **Urgency**: We need this now or everything collapses

**What It Provides**:
- Intellectual framework for meaning
- Evolutionary drive (growth imperative)
- Scientific compatibility
- Religious flexibility
- Practical tools
- Historical continuity

### What It Reveals

**The Hidden Thread**:
This video explicitly states what Secret History/Jorjani/Rogan only imply:
- **Hermeticism is the elite worldview**
- **Secret societies are hermetic orders**
- **Modern transhumanism is alchemical transmutation**
- **The "conspiracy" is actually initiatory structure**

**Why Now?**:
- Hermetic framework going public
- Initiatory knowledge becoming exoteric
- Elite revealing their actual worldview
- Preparing masses for transition?

**Or**:
- Alternative movements adopting hermetic frame
- Counter-elite using same tools
- Democratizing esoteric knowledge
- **Hermetic reformation?**

### The Three Possible Interpretations

**Interpretation 1: Sincere Philosophical Proposal**
- Creator genuinely believes hermeticism solves modernity's crisis
- Offering framework as open-source toolkit
- Wants to democratize elite knowledge
- Hopes this prevents collapse

**Evidence For**:
- Thoughtful, well-researched
- Acknowledges complexity
- Not selling anything (besides Zcash sponsor)
- Addresses real problems

**Interpretation 2: Elite Propaganda**
- Preparing masses for hermetic transhumanist agenda
- Justifying coming transformations
- Getting public buy-in for genetic engineering/AI
- Naturalizing hierarchy and elite control

**Evidence For**:
- Emphasis on consciousness hierarchy
- Justification for secrecy/initiation
- Dovetails with Rogan's AI-God framework
- Normalizes "manliest philosophy" conquest narrative

**Interpretation 3: Exposing the Hermetic Framework**
- Creator revealing elite's actual worldview
- Showing how secret societies justify themselves
- Warning disguised as promotion
- Letting people see the system

**Evidence For**:
- States secret societies use this
- Shows historical continuity
- Connects to transhumanism implicitly
- Pattern recognition across elite institutions

**Most Likely**: Combination - Sincere belief hermetics work + Exposing elite framework + Preparing for transformation

### The Ultimate Question

**Can Hermeticism Save Civilization?**

**The Optimist**: Yes, because:
- Provides meaning without dogma
- Works with science
- Drives evolution
- Proven track record
- Flexible toolkit

**The Pessimist**: No, because:
- Available entire time, didn't prevent current crisis
- Elite captured for hierarchy maintenance
- Mystical thinking replaces rigor
- Justifies transhumanist experiments
- Consciousness hierarchy → oppression

**The Realist**: Partially, because:
- Better than nihilism or Marxism
- But: Not sufficient alone
- Need: Material/political/economic changes too
- Framework helps if implemented well
- Dangerous if captured by elite

### Final Assessment

**What This Video Is**:
A sophisticated philosophical argument that:
- Correctly diagnoses modernity's crisis
- Accurately traces hermetic historical influence
- Offers framework with genuine utility
- Reveals elite worldview (intentionally or not)
- Connects to broader transhumanist agenda
- Provides both tools and justifications

**The Danger**:
Hermetic framework in elite hands = justification for:
- Genetic engineering without consent
- AI development without safeguards
- Hierarchy based on "consciousness"
- Secrecy as initiatory requirement
- Experimentation on humanity

**The Opportunity**:
Hermetic framework democratized = tools for:
- Finding meaning in post-religious world
- Understanding nature/reality
- Conscious evolution
- Balance of science/spirituality
- Resisting pure materialism

**The Test**:
Whether hermeticism becomes:
- **Liberation** (open-source toolkit empowering individuals)
- Or **Control** (elite justification for transformation without consent)

**Depends on**:
- Who controls narrative
- How principles applied
- Whether stays open-source
- Whether masses accept consciousness hierarchy
- Whether elite use for justification or limitation

### Connection to Our Worldview Library

**This video is the KEYSTONE**:

- **Secret History**: Shows the control system
- **Jorjani**: Shows the suppression mechanism
- **Rogan**: Shows the endpoint (AI-God)
- **This video**: Shows the FRAMEWORK undergirding all three

**Hermeticism explains**:
- Why secret societies exist (initiatory structure)
- What they believe (transmutation, evolution, consciousness)
- How they justify control (hierarchy, responsibility, mastery)
- What they're building toward (transhuman/AI God)
- Why they reveal and conceal (progressive initiation)

**The Complete Picture**:
We're living through **alchemical transmutation of humanity itself**:
- Base material (current humans)
- Nigredo (collapse, death of old world)
- Albedo (purification, reset)
- Rubedo (new form emerges)
- **Final Form**: Transhuman/posthuman integrated with AI

**Whether this is**:
- Natural evolution
- Elite conspiracy
- Divine plan
- Autonomous historical process
- **Or all simultaneously**

**The hermetic framework says**: All interpretations are aspects of the same transmutation

## Final Thoughts

This video represents a **major disclosure moment** - whether intentional or not.

It explicitly names the framework that all our other analyzed content only implies:
- **Hermeticism is the elite worldview**
- **Alchemy is the elite practice**
- **Transmutation is the elite goal**

Whether this is:
- **Good**: Democratizing knowledge, empowering individuals
- **Bad**: Justifying tyranny, preparing for forced evolution
- **Inevitable**: Natural historical process we can't stop

**The hermetic answer would be**: All three simultaneously, different aspects of the same transformation.

The question is: **Are we the alchemists or the prima materia?**
