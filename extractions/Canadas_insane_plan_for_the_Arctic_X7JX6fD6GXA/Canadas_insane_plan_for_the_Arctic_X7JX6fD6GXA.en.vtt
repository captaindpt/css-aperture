00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.520
Canada is concerned.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.440
NORAD has existed since the Cold War.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.400
The Canadian Arctic was then fitted with complex
networks of radar stations,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.920
and their goal was to detect incoming threats
from the Soviet Union.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.080
Like most Arctic projects of that era,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.120
it was built and operated largely by the United States.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.320
But if we look at the Canadian Arctic today,
it paints a different picture.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.680
These lands are remote and lack critical infrastructure.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.000
They haven't been developed like Alaska,
and they aren't being used

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.520
for trade and defense like the Russian Arctic.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.640
Well, Canada controls a third of the Arctic region,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.800
their investments only account for 2%.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.200
Is it time for Canada to start developing

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600
the Arctic, like the US or Russia?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.000
Or is there a good reason to stand back?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.560
This is the Canadian Arctic...

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.600
with Hindsight.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.720
The balance of power is shifting north.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.840
Canada's map stretches

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.080
from the Pacific to Atlantic and Arctic Ocean,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.320
but these northern lands
haven't yet reached provincial status.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.080
And this might become a geopolitical flashpoint.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.560
A new trade route.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.320
The Northwest Passage is opening as sea ice retreats.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.920
But on the other side of the north Pole,
there's a more immediate threat.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.680
Russia is increasing its Arctic defense investments,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.200
and thus defense budgets everywhere are rising.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.520
Canada is now planning to use this
to massively develop its Arctic region.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.840
A big change is coming and let me explain why.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.360
Long before Europeans arrived,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.920
These lands were inhabited by indigenous peoples.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.960
In 1867,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.800
four colonies joined in the south

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.760
as the Dominion of Canada

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.800
and that same year the United States bought Alaska.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.600
The Americans were aggressively

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.880
expanding west, and the Canadians feared

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.640
that they might wanted to expand into the prairies.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.760
Canada set the goal to expand from sea to sea.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.040
The vast North American continent

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.600
was inhabited by groups of indigenous peoples,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.800
and most of it was owned by the Hudson's Bay company.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.600
They bought furs from indigenous hunters

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.800
 and transported them over a vast network of rivers

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.000
 and trails to European markets.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.240
But by the late 1860s, when Canada was formed,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.280
fashion trends had evolved

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.160
and the company was struggling.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.040
In the West, British Columbia, then a colony of the United Kingdom,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.120
also had deep financial problems,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.320
and they feared that the Americans

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.160
would want to absorb their territory

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.080
to have a land connection to Alaska.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.000
So they struck a deal.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.080
The Hudson's Bay company sold their lands to Canada

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.880
for 300,000 pounds,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.360
which is roughly 8.2 million USD in today's money.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.640
This region in the south gained provincial status

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.800
and the rest remained a territory

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.080
and the following year, British Columbia joined as a province in part

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.520
for a promise to build a railroad.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.720
Canada over the next few decades expanded from sea to sea.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.640
The British transferred the Arctic Archipelago,
and down south

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.960
they continued carving out new provinces

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.760
out of their acquired territory.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.760
The Klondike Gold Rush led to the creation of the Yukon

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.720
and a surge of immigration
led to Alberta and Saskatchewan.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.200
It wasn't until 1949, with the inclusion of Newfoundland,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.280
that they truly had expanded from coast to coast

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.040
with Canadian provinces, but the northernmost regions

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.920
were still largely undeveloped

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.000
and were Canadian territories.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.080
This is where we started to see

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.440
a major change between Canada and the United States.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.360
Washington aggressively funded the development of Alaska,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.040
its Arctic territory,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.240
and immigrants flocked to the region
in search of quick riches.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.600
Their population increased substantially over the years,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.240
and particularly after WW2.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.880
But Canada didn't pursue such policies.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.240
They didn't encourage population growth.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560
They didn't build supportive infrastructure

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.360
or military facilities.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.400
The indigenous communities that lived here

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.640
were still largely ignored from a policy standpoint,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.520
but that is changing.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.960
The Canadian Arctic consists of three territories.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.640
The Northwest Territories and Nunavut,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.200
and they're extremely sparsely populated.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.800
Nunavut alone covers almost 2,000,000km², yet

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.080
only 40,000 people live here.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.200
85% are indigenous.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.120
The highest percentage of the three.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.920
In a Northwest Territories,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.080
indigenous people make up about half of the population.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.480
and in Yukon, little over 20%.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.600
And life here is tough.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.160
Canada is currently living through an extreme affordability crisis.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.360
Prices are rising incredibly fast
while wages aren't keeping up.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.800
But it's even worse in the Arctic.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.880
Most consumer goods here are imported by air,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.880
and this isolation makes everything expensive.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.080
Since 2000, consumer prices

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.760
have risen between 40 and 60% on average.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.880
But there are very few opportunities here to compensate

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.320
higher prices with higher wages.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.320
Many jobs here depend on seasonal mining activities,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.680
on federal funding or government jobs.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.040
But there's something in the air.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.920
I already told you that the early
mission of Canada was to expand

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.320
from sea to sea,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.520
and that is now become their official motto.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.880
But there's another sea up there.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.960
The Arctic Ocean for most of the year is covered with ice.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.440
But that is decreasing.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.120
The maximum extent of sea ice

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.160
has been trending down for decades,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.400
and this opens these waters for shipping.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.480
The number of ships in the region

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.880
has increased by 37% over the last decade or so.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.840
And once these waters are safe enough

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.840
for consistent container traffic,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.120
it would change global supply chains.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.840
This is something that has already been
substantially covered in other YouTube videos.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.200
And this is the idea.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.920
A ship that is traveling from Asia to Europe

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.680
would no longer have to go through the Panama Canal.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.880
And this would help them
save thousands of miles of travel

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.240
and hundreds of thousands of dollars on fuel.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.720
Canada could charge a transit fee,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.120
and this could help support local communities.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.560
But there is a more immediate upside to retreating ice.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.920
Tourism.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.600
It has become commonplace for major cruise liners

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.040
to offer trips to the Canadian Arctic.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.560
The region is an ecological wonderland

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.680
with a strong cultural heritage, and it's pristine.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.600
All these places have been visited by cruise ships

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.720
between 2014 and 2019.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.880
This could evolve into a major segment of the economy,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.120
providing jobs for local communities.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.960
The number of cruise ships
has more than doubled since the 1990s,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.960
and the number of pleasure yachts has increased

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.880
by a factor of 40.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.560
Tourism can play a part in the development of this region,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.800
but currently it's still a niche sector.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.840
In 2024,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.840
the vast archipelago was only visited by 87 cruise ships.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.560
The vast majority of ships are fishing vessels,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.840
which is another segment of the economy
that is now opening.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.960
Less sea ice means less treacherous waters

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.760
and a longer window of opportunity to fish.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.520
There are also believed to be some natural resources,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.040
especially in this bay between Canada and Greenland.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.840
But none of these matters if Canada's
sovereignty isn't recognized.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.000
In 1985,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.760
a U.S. Coast Guard vessel transited the Northwest Passage

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.240
without requesting permission from Canada.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.600
Canada responded by drawing straight baselines around the archipelago,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.880
which in simple terms means that it declared

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.160
these waters as internal waters

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.600
where foreign countries need Canada's permission to sail.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.600
But that's not recognized by everyone.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.320
China made its position clear.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.960
They consider these international waters,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.120
where they believe all countries are free to pass.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.320
The position of the United States has remained unchanged.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.840
The US fears that if they accept Canada's

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.760
claim that these are internal waters,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.680
that it would set a precedent for other countries to do the same.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.160
Iran could argue that the Strait of Hormuz

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.000
is an internal waterway.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.520
China could say that the South China Sea are internal waters.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.960
They defend the broader
principle of freedom of navigation,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.200
also in a Canadian Arctic.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.920
It doesn't help Canada's case, though,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.720
that the Arctic region is so desolate.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.040
This is the Arctic population by country.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.760
Most people live in Russia,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.360
followed by the US and second to last, Canada.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.240
Even though 40% of Canada's landmass

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.760
 lies within the Arctic region,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.440
only about 0.3% of the population live here.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.280
They invest substantially less in the Arctic than other countries.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.800
Arctic investments account for just 0.6% of
total government investments

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.360
 between 2017 and 2021,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.840
which doesn't change anything about Canada's
sovereignty in the Arctic.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.960
But it does make Canada less of an Arctic power.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.840
I like to look at these stories in a wider

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.600
historical perspective, and the story of Canada

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.280
started with the expansion from coast to coast,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.840
 and technically the already reached the coast up there as well.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.600
But these territories, these northern regions,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.200
they are still categorized as territories.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.240
They are sparsely populated.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.480
They lack critical infrastructure

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.520
and diversified economies.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.880
Ukraine was a turning point.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.040
The Arctic Council was suspended and Canada and the U.S.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.320
announced multi-billion dollar deals.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.520
NORAD is unique.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.280
It is the only military command structure in the world

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.120
that is shared by two countries.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.600
The commander is a U.S. 4 star General,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.440
 and a deputy commander, a Canadian 3 star General.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.800
They watch for incoming aircrafts or missile threats.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.120
Most of them are approaching through the Arctic.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.080
Since 2022,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.080
they announced major deals amounting to billions

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.080
and sometimes tens of billions of dollars to invest

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.880
in modernizing these systems.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.640
This happened before during the Cold War,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.400
and this led to very brief, localized economic growth,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.320
but it didn't translate into prosperity on the ground.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.920
Many American companies were contracted,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.080
and many radar stations were staffed by Americans

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.360
or Canadians from southern regions.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.960
But this time around, the Canadian government

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.000
put community outcomes front and center.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.440
They prioritize northern contractors.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.480
They focus on building infrastructure
that serves the military

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.560
as well as local communities

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.480
and they aim to create jobs for locals.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.360
These are the stated goals of the Canadian government.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.400
This is their central philosophy this time around

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.360
 to use defense spending to help develop the Arctic region in some way

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.240
similar to what the United States has done in Alaska.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.920
And while everything I've said so far
about the relatively low level of investment

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.440
 of Canada in its Arctic regions is true,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.600
there's another side to this story.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.160
In 1999, 

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.200
Canada separated the Northwest Territories to create Nunavut.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.520
The goal was to give Inuit people greater self-governance

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.920
 over their traditional lands.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.680
And this was the largest land claims agreement in world history.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.480
Canada has protected large swaths of wilderness.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.600
They took a leading role
in promoting peaceful cooperation

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.680
when they founded the Arctic Council,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.520
and they have made great progress by

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.880
empowering indigenous communities through

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.160
revenue sharing agreements and investments
in health care and education.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.000
I'm rooting for them.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.240
I fail to see how these waters could be anything but Canadian.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.760
Regardless of whether publicly saying sell is a strategic

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.600
policy decision, they just have to start acting

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.280
a little bit more like it.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.400
So we put a lot of effort and time and money

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.760
into making these videos,
but lately we've not had a lot of success.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.720
We've had quite a number of videos that underperformed,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.800
and that's also one of the reasons
why I'm not working with sponsors

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.680
that much as I did in the past.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.960
And I can see from the analytics that most of you
that are watching this

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.760
video are not subscribed to the channel.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.600
If you're looking for an effortless

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.760
and free way to help support my work,
consider subscribing to the channel.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.400
Another thing that would really help
is if you could like this video or if you could show

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.640
some positive engagement in the comment section,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.880
because this helps trigger the YouTube algorithm.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.640
And then after that, here are two more videos

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.560
that you can consider for your next watch.
