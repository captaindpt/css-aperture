So, I messaged my closest friends. Can
you tell me what question you have that
you wouldn't ever say out loud? Give me
a few. How can I be satisfied with just
one sexual partner? I have my partner.
Should I tell them? I no longer find my
partner attractive, but I don't know how
to tell her. We have a lot to talk
about. You going to record me today?
Okay. All right. Here's what I would
suggest. Esther PL is regarded as one of
the most sought after relationship
therapists in the world. For the past 40
years, she's been helping millions of
people with her brutally honest and
wildly relatable insights. People are
having less sex. Why is the sex getting
less interesting? No, their life with
each other is less interesting. And what
concerns me at this moment, it's the
loss of social skills, but they are
vital to us. And we have less and less
opportunities to practice because we are
pursuing connection beyond the human
world. People don't have partner sex,
they have sex on porn. We also are
surrounded by algorithmic perfections
and that's creating warped expectations
that we bring to our relationships and
then there's the misery of the dating
app. Have you heard this story of the
guy who swiped 2 million times to get
one date? Oh god. It appears that you
have many options but you'll swipe swipe
swipe and you're going to get frustrated
because you don't get matched with
anybody. But don't make the app become
the replacement where you can actually
go outside, meet people, and also deal
with rejection because it's a major
feature to develop relationships. But
we've never been more free, but we've
never been more alone and more filled
with self-doubt. So, tell me how to fix
it in order to have a great
relationship. There's a ton of really
important things. The first thing this
This has always blown my mind a little
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the
show. So, could I ask you for a favor
before we start? If you like the show
and you like what we do here and you
want to support us, the free simple way
that you can do just that is by hitting
the subscribe button. And my commitment
to you is if you do that, then I'll do
everything in my power, me and my team,
to make sure that this show is better
for you every single week. We'll listen
to your feedback. We'll find the guests
that you want me to speak to and we'll
continue to do what we do. Thank you so
much.

Esther, with all that you know and with
all that you study and with all that you
research and write about and think
about,
what is it that concerns you most? What
is front of mind for you when you think
about mating and dating and human
connection?
What concerns me most
I think is the fact that uh there is a
unique moment in history at this moment
where we are redesigning our
communication our way ways of connecting
our ways of answering the big questions
but specifically in the realm of
relationships it's social atrophy I
think we are losing social skills and
the word atrophy for anyone that doesn't
know is atrophy is when you don't use
muscles they go numb. Social atrophy is
when you no longer know how to speak to
people. And what is the cost of that? If
we do lose that social ability to to
connect and to have happen stance, what
price do we pay? Why does life get
harder? And how does it get harder?
Because we are social creatures. We are
wired for connection.
If we we live longer because we are
connected. We don't live longer because
we are master biohackers.
We need those connections. They are just
literally vital to us. So, um it's not
that we have replaced this, you know,
and and our skills are still honed in.
We don't we have less and less
opportunities to practice.
If you do sports and you don't practice
your sport, you wouldn't be asking me
what is the price. You would know that
if you don't play and it's been years of
not playing, then that thing is out of
your life. Done. But you can do other
things, whereas you can't live without
connection. So many people are really
dissatisfied with the choices they have
for connection. Now, I'm sure we're all
to blame, but when I when I scroll
through my my feed on social media, one
of the things I've seen lately, I saw it
just before you arrived and also a
couple of days ago, was people so angry
at dating apps. Mhm. And I've got
friends close to me who are furious that
their only apparent option to meet
someone these days. Go outside, go walk
your dog, go run, go with a bike group,
go to a go do life and you will meet
people. I mean, you create situations.
It's not, you know, where are the
available situations? Where are the the
options for meeting people? You create
options. You know, you're at a you're at
a coffee shop, you're ordering a coffee,
ask the person next to you if you can
offer them one. Can do something that
actually invites relatedness.
And I know the anger at the app. I get
that, you know. I I'm actually quite
connected to to to this whole world of
dating apps. But I think that it's a
tool. Use it but don't make it become
the replacement for the multitudes of
situations.
Yesterday I sat on a plane. I spoke for
3 hours with two people just because
there was no Wi-Fi.
It was just an amazing conversation and
and all of us at the moment we landed
said to each other, "Wow, if we had had
Wi-Fi, we wouldn't have talked to each
other one bit or five minutes and then
be done with this." It's all these
situations that we don't take advantage
of. We used where we used to always talk
to people. And I think if you just rely
on the app, you will go through a loop.
You'll go on it. You'll swipe, swipe,
swipe. You'll respond with the least
amount of effort possible because you've
so burned out already from doing this
that you don't really want to give much
of yourself. If you don't give much of
yourself, you're not going to get the
kind of responses that you want. Then
you're going to get frustrated because
you don't get matched with anybody. But
you don't look at your own laziness that
is not particularly invited for someone
to actually want to match with you. And
then you say now I'm tired of this. So
now you get off the app for 6 months.
You take a break. You say I'm done with
the apps. And then six months later you
say I don't want to meet someone. And
what do you do? You go back on the app
instead of thinking of the multitudes of
situations where you can actually meet
people. And it's become so weird to talk
to somebody. you know, you can sit next
to someone and at the at the counter and
it's like you're a weirdo if you start
talking to me instead of, you know, why
not? Cuz even in the situation of your
plane ride, if there had been Wi-Fi,
those people wouldn't have wanted to
talk to you. So really, regardless of
your attempt, you would have been met
with, you know, rejection to some
degree, social rejection.
Maybe, maybe. But you know, the original
app, if you really want to understand
the gamification of that, it was really
done as a way to not have to put
yourself out and have to deal with
rejection. But do you rejection is a
major feature of relationships. Learning
to live with people who say no to us
is essential. Have you heard this story
of the guy who tracked his Tinder
swipes? And the story is that he swiped
two million times to get one date. And
you can kind of see this is him here.
This is the image of the of the swipe.
So it says this guy swiped 2 million
58,000 times. He got 2,000 matches from
that. Mhm. Which turned into 1,200 chats
which turned into one date.
Such a system is failing a huge
percentage of people. This is the chap
on WhatsApp on Tinder, I believe it was.
This is Here he is. I'll put him on the
screen so everyone can see. Mhm. And you
can kind of see the the photos that he
he led with on his dating profile. He
probably shouldn't be holding a massive
fish. I'm not sure many women are into
that, but Oh, he's got the fish picture.
Yes. Yes. For people like him, what's
the honest advice that someone like him
needs? Because you know clearly dating
apps aren't going to work for him which
is a lot of us from what I read. But how
many hours he should also have put on
the amount of hours that he Oh it does
have that. So has the hours too. So has
the amount of time he's been a member of
the apps just over five years almost six
years. Yes. I mean the first thing if if
you sat in my office and you told me
this I would not spend my time
discussing what you're doing on the app.
I would discuss what you're doing off
the app. And if you ever are even off
the app,
I mean, have you the amount of hours of
swiping that you've done, obviously this
is not yielding anything. Why are you
continuing? 5 years is an enormous
amount of time in your life. I feel sad
for you. You know, have you tried any
other ways? Have you have you been with
with your friends? Do you have friends?
Have your friends introduced you to
people? Have you gone to places where
you are more likely to meet people? I
don't know what you're interested in,
but if your fishing is one of those
things, you know, maybe even at the fish
market you could meet, but I mean more
of it isn't going to give you more of
it. It's just going to make you more
frustrated. So, if you were sat there,
there's a rigidity to this. It's like,
what are you trying to prove? You know,
go try something else. If you're trying
to park in a space that you can't get
in, at some point, don't you go look for
another space? Is there an element of
this where, you know, from what I heard
from dating apps, there's only a small
percentage of men that could basically
get all the opportunity if I I'll put
the numbers on the screen, but yeah, I
know the holes. Yes. And a large
proportion of women get lots of
opportunity because lots of men swipe
for But opportunity for what to be
swiped does that mean? There's and then
what the main thing is can we have a
conversation about emotional capitalism
you know I go I try I I I try to get the
best I try to shop you know I try to to
maximize my chances but fundamentally
the app originally was broadening your
circle. It gave you the opportunity to
meet people that you would otherwise not
meet. There was something very beautiful
about that. From that it became a
commodification. People treat each other
like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] People ghost each other left
and right. People tell each other things
and then disappear. People don't have to
say, "I'm not interested in seeing you
again." They just close the shop. And
the misery is not because they haven't
met someone. The misery is the treatment
that this kind of semi anonymity enables
you. You don't have to be polite
anymore. You don't have to treat people
with minimum decency.
And that's what hurts people. That that
makes people bitter, angry, doubting
themselves. A lot of things like that.
It's part of the challenge that I have
so many apparent options. Now, as
someone on these dating apps, it's kind
of like going to a when you go to like
Asia or Thailand and you get the menu
and the menu is so big, they'll like
make anything you want. So, you find it
hard to choose. And also any choice you
make, you realize that it's come at the
cost of so many other things you could
have had. So it's less special, it's
less scarce. And in a world of Instagram
and dating apps, it appears that I have
100,000 options. Yes, it appears that
you have many options. And it appears
that you have a paradox of choice. And
it appears that you constantly are
dealing with the FOMO of what else is
around the corner. But the interesting
thing is when I work with people, I
spend a lot of time reading reading what
they actually post. Even a peacock is
more creative than us, you know, in how
they attract people, in what you say, in
what, hey, what's up?
want to hang.
Is that giving you any energy in your
body? Okay. I mean, this is half the the
messages.
I'm watching. I'm chilling. Okay. Well,
keep chilling. It's like where is the
energy? Where, you know, there's
something about called flirting,
attracting someone, showing an interest,
etc., etc., etc. What's a better thing
for us to say? Oh, man. You know, show
interest. I saw something in your
picture. Uh, I'm wondering, you know, if
we went to listen to music, what's the
first band we would go to listen to?
Something that says you are a person
with life, with interest, with
curiosity. Show curiosity. It's probably
the first thing that you do when you are
drawn to somebody. I guess if I've been
rejected so much, as you said, I've been
kind of demoralized. The energy has been
taken out of me. So now it's just become
this sort of cycle of just well then
don't do it then go then do something
else for a while. Don't stay in that
pattern. It's it's it's really
depleting. But the thing about the
choice is that we also are living
surrounded by algorithmic perfections
and predictive technologies that are
trying to deliver us always, you know,
on demand delivery of our everyday life
always on without any friction and that
is creating warped expectations that we
bring to our relationships. That very
same expectation for perfection and
forcopantic
responses, you know. So the more we are
interacting with AIS and the more we are
re receiving a different kind of
response, the more challenging it will
be for us to actually deal with real
people and and to face what you call
rejection. Not every refusal is a
rejection. I mean this guy didn't write
how many times he wasn't interested. He
only tells you what's happening to him.
He gives you the victim story. It's a
statement of this thing doesn't work for
me and men don't get answered on the app
and you get this whole plight but
there's no context. I can't give you a
and I don't think anybody should
actually respond to this without knowing
all these other details. Is there an
issue when you mentioned men there is
there an issue that gender roles have
shifted and when we think about the
plight of men they are you know this I
think the single biggest killer of men
over the age of 45 is themselves and the
gender roles um have shifted so much
that often men have less purpose
feelings of purpose and worth now than
they used to have. Women and men have
got gotten closer to a point of
financial equality. they've gotten
closer um than the past which now kind
of also means that the role of a man if
we think historically is less clear than
the role of a man maybe 50 100 years
ago. To understand masculinity you have
to understand the broader spectrum of
relationships.
So relationships used to be about duty
and obligation, loyalty and community.
And happiness came not from what you do
for yourself, but happiness came from
having fulfilled your role and your
mission and your obligation to the
people that you owe to your family
primarily. That model is still the
prevailing model in most parts of the
world. We shifted that model from duty
and obligation to option and choice. And
so now we have zero clarity and a lot of
freedom. And we've never been more free,
but we've never been more alone and more
confused and more filled with
self-doubt. How how long have you been
working with
men and women in a relationship love
connection? 40 years. So what have you
seen change in the conversation around
men and masculinity? Like what are the
different problems that men are talking
about in when they speak to you that
they weren't speaking about when you
started your career? I mean you can
start with the subject of loneliness.
Loneliness, which is a a a general
societal issue at this point, is
definitely a major affliction, even more
so for boys and men. Okay? Loneliness
was not a the story of men in the 19th
century. Men hunted together, men hiked
together, men gathered together, men
went to the bar together. Men had
conversations with other men. Men meant
met, you know. So the there is nothing
inherent about men that sets them up for
more loneliness and isolation.
That is really important to understand.
Men, boys till the age of four and then
till the age of seven are highly
emotional. They can articulate. They can
so these are cultural phenomenons. These
are social developments. This is not
biological. This is not intrinsic to
men. One shift that's taken place which
I'm keen to get your perspective on is
relates to sex. One in three men under
30 in the US reported no sex in the past
year. That's triple the rate from 2008.
Millennials and Gen Z's are having less
sex than any generation since records
began despite more access to the dating
apps we talked about. Yeah. In Japan
over 40% of young adults are virgins and
they say many say that they have no
interest in sex. Mhm. And lastly,
married couples in the UK and the United
States report a steady decline in sexual
frequency since the early 2000s. Yeah, I
wrote about that in Mating in Captivity
that came out in 2006. That's 20 years
ago. Yes. Because in order to have sex
with a female partner, if that's the man
you're talking about, you need to be
able to approach her. And so social
atrophy is directly connected to what is
often called the sexual recession.
I mean I in in mating 20 years ago I
have an entire chapter where someone
basically says to me I'd rather have the
security of an MBA than of a
relationship.
Okay. And at that point already you
began to see that adolescence in the
United States it's not everywhere in the
world but certainly in the US and where
more and more going in groups and having
less and less pair bonding and less and
less romantic relationships that
accompany you through your adolescence
that develop with you and you basically
develop sex as part of a plot and not as
something that at some point your
hormones force you to do. But a story, a
story, a relationship is a story. And
then at suddenly you arrive at a certain
age and now you're looking at this other
person with whom you want to have sex
and it's like this unknown continent
that you have to conquer. But but you've
never spoken with those people. You have
very little female friends who are just
friends who help you understand what
happens with your girlfriend. You know,
there's an entire social map that has
dissipated. So the sex is the last thing
on the list of all these disconnects
that then of course lead you to have
this kind of statistic and that means
with partners they have plenty of sex
maybe with themselves and others other
other
but it's partnered sex here that is that
is involved right they have sex on porn
they have sex
they don't have partner sex you know do
you understand when I say to you this is
a you can add that to your statistics
too that the majority of men who come to
sex therapy today for erectile
dysfunctions are young men in their 20s,
not old men after prostate issues.
Really? Yes. Why? Because they spend an
enormous amount of time with themselves
watching porn and masturbating. Yes.
Because in order to be able to maintain
erections with a partner, it's an it's
an it's an attunement, right? It's a
resonance. It's grooving together. But
if you've always just been by yourself,
then you only know how to kind of be
connected to your own physiological
responses. I've worried about this
before. I've worried that if I watch
pornography that I will like desensitize
myself to the real thing. Depends how
much, depends if what else is there in
your life. I mean, it's not an all or
nothing thing. But what I'm saying is
social atrophy. The the the gradual
disconnect of the multiple touch points
between people leads to then the
challenges that are also sexual leads to
the kind of social isolation leads to
people confusing friends and friendship.
So they can have a thousand virtual
friends but no one to feed their cat.
You know it's it's it's all para no one
to feed their cat. Yeah. Who would pick
up a prescription at the pharmacy? who
may pick me up at the airport,
who will go check on on someone I care
about if I happen to not be there. Yes.
Who shows up for me? Because it's
foundational to trust. Who can I lean
on? Do you have my back? Can I rely on
you?
So do you think the partnered sex is in
decline because because they're still
having sex but they're doing it on their
own now with in part sex is in decline
because social connection is in decline
because people have less friends because
people the statistics on who you call to
when you are in trouble are really
terrible. People have no one to confide
in. So what how does that impact my sex
with my partner? Well, you you won't
have a partner usually. What this
statistic says is that there is no
partner. Young men the age of 30 don't
have sex with partners. This one here
from the British Medical Journal says
that married couples in the UK and US
report a steady decline in sexual
frequency. Yes. Since basically the
internet. Yeah. So here's how this
works. How much time do you spend in
front of a screen during the day? Nine
hours. All right. And then you sometimes
think now I'm going to go home and I'm
finally can close the screens. Yeah. But
then you're so tired that all you can do
is watch TV. Yeah. And then while you
watch TV, you're also scrolling on your
phone. Yeah. And then while you're
watching TV and scrolling on your phone,
there may be somebody sitting next to
you that does the exact same thing.
Yeah. All right. And then somebody may
even say something to the other person
who goes, "Uh-huh."
Doesn't look at them. Uh-huh.
Very interesting. And you really wonder
why people are having less sex.
It is. It's hard. It's hard. I'm going
to say it is hard. Right. So, people are
experiencing at that moment what I've
come to call ambiguous loss.
Ambiguous loss is when I'm actually with
somebody, but I don't feel the
closeness, the intimacy, the connection
from actually being with that person. I
don't know if you're here or not here.
Ambiguous loss is actually a term that
was developed by Pauline Bos, a
psychologist who talked about it when
you have a person who has Alzheimer or
dementia and they are actually
physically in front of you but they are
emotionally or psychologically gone or
people who are deployed or have
disappeared or miscarriage where people
are no longer physically there but they
are emotionally very very present inside
of you. In both cases you don't know are
they here or are they not. Do I say
goodbye or do I hold on? When I am doing
this looking at your phone and I have
like the a still face and I'm barely
responding to you who said something
that may be quite important. You don't
know are you here but you're not
present.
I'm with you, but I'm not experiencing
any of the things that one experiences
from the closeness of being with you,
like Alzheimer, dementia, physically
there, but psychologically elsewhere.
Because it's not just that you're not
here, it's that you're in another world.
You're gone somewhere. You may be
talking to who knows.
And I guess this is the from reading
your work, this is the crux of many an
argument. The argument might sound like,
oh, you didn't put the toilet seat down,
but it's actually linked to
something else, something deeper under
the surface.
I I just see it, you know, specifically
when me and my partner have been away
from each other for a long time and then
we come back together. I always know
we're going to argue for the first like
one or two days. It's not even going to
be an argument. It's going to be
there's going to be a problem. And the
problem is usually around expectations,
which is I come in and my head is still
d like I'm still a million miles away,
maybe on a different frequency, thinking
about lots of things. And I think she
comes into that space expecting
connection and I let her down. And we've
tried to like call it out and say,
"Listen, when we come back together,
let's just, you know, both make an
effort in that direction." But, um,
going back to your point of ambiguous
loss, it's like it's almost like she's
trying to test if I'm
connected to her. And I sometimes don't
do a good job of that because of how I
come into that space. Like for example,
right now I'm filming Dragon STEM, which
is a TV show in Manchester. And so I
film three or four days a week, morning
till night. The minute I get off from
it, I'm back with her. So you can
imagine everything hits me at once.
Do you what I'm saying? Yes. Like all of
my team, all the to-do list, everything.
Steve, we need you to sign this off all
at once, but then I'm back in front of
her. Mhm. So she's experiencing that
ambiguous loss. And the expectation was
that we haven't seen each other for a
while. So this is, you know, so the
question is, can you carve out a half an
hour that's clean? An hour that's clean
that connects. Yeah. But don't do that
just for her. You have to imagine that
when you do what you do and it all is
bleeding into each other and all your
roles collapse into the same space that
it actually is doing something for you.
to you, not for you, to you. And that to
to actually close the phone,
tell people to call you in an hour, you
won't miss a thing. And to actually drop
is going to give you a level of energy,
of oxytocin, of well-being that is way
more important or as important as every
supplement you may be swallowing.
Yeah. Cuz you're It's true. I think it's
not just for her. Yeah, I am excited to
see her and I am excited to connect in
here. I just You said it wrong. You said
it correctly. Like I just multi I try
and multitask and I I let everything
down. Yes. The boss, the podcaster, the
this, the that and the boyfriend is all
in the same thing. Um it's an
indigestion. So you're a fan of
scheduling clean time to do things. Oh
yeah. Oh yeah. It's you can call it
scheduling, you can call it demarcation,
you can call it delineation. We are
social creatures who really orient
ourselves in time and in space. When
everything happens to us at the same
time, we get headaches. They not always
experienced as headaches, but in fact,
we get a confusion inside. We're not
here, we're not here, we're not here,
we're not here, it's just okay. So, you
can call that scheduling or you can call
it that, you know, when you go to place
when you go to the gym, you basically
put on certain clothes, you prepare
yourself for that. It's an activity that
comes with a role that comes with a set
of things that comes with a delineation
of time that makes you go to a certain
space
where you're going to go do that thing
and we this happens when you go out at
night this when you go out for dinner
when you the same thing is for home.
It's a if you are going to spend the
moment with her, however short it is, if
it's clean and present, not just kind of
semi there, ambiguously present, it will
change a lot of things for you, for her,
and for the two of you. Before we sat
down today, I messaged a group of 10 of
my closest friends. I put them all in a
group chat, and I told them I was going
to be speaking to you today. So I said
to them, "Can you tell me what question
you have for Esther Pel?" These are all
my 10 of my best friends that you
wouldn't ever say out loud. How can I be
satisfied with just one sexual partner?
I have been unfaithful with my partner
in the past
and I feel guilty about it. Should I
tell them?
I no longer find my partner attractive,
but I don't know how to tell her. I love
her but I don't find her attractive.
Those are probably the most interesting
ones.
I think the one that I would probably uh
address is also uh about the infidelity
and about your guilt. That's that and
also to this person read state of
affairs because I spent many years
writing this book about infidelity and
trying to offer a very nuanced
perspective on this very subject. But
here's the thing
to tell somebody something just because
you don't have a clean conscience and
you feel guilty isn't always the kind
thing to do.
Ask yourself what will happen to your
partner or to your relationship for that
matter if you speak about this now
and who you doing it for. I think
honesty sometimes is extremely caring
and at other times can be very cruel.
It cleanses you and it destroys another
person.
deal with your responsibility and deal
with your guilt and face the
consequences of your behavior and treat
your partner with all the good things
that actually say I now am willing to
really invest in here and and make up
for what I did without having to destroy
the narrative of the relationship
because everybody has a story about
their relationship. Everybody has a set
of shared assumptions about their
relationship. And you are going to come
in and just say, "Last year or two years
ago or five years ago, I did X, Y, and
Z." And from that moment on, you rob the
other person of their narrative.
You may think you did something that was
honest, and sometimes that is the case.
But many times you actually create an
enormous amount of hurt. If you feel
guilty, it's not bad. Deal with your
guilt. Face it. Take your responsibility
and make your relationship the best
relationship you can. And honor your
partner in that way. Don't honor them by
putting your dirt onto them. That is a
different way of saying and that is not
for everyone. But I think that it is an
important perspective to include here
because we live in this era where
transparency supposedly is the the best
model for everything. And people dish
stuff out on other people that destroys
them
in the name of and when you're no longer
attracted to your person, you know, ask
yourself what is that about? You know,
is it are you paying attention? are you?
Um I think people often just think that
attraction is something like I look at
you and I should just instantly have a
response,
you know. Um and sometimes it's also
because I haven't really taken a good
look and sometimes it's because what I'm
looking at isn't necessarily anymore
what draws me in. And sometime it's it's
not, you know, attraction is a very fle
fluid thing. It comes and go. When I'm
angry at you, I'm not nearly as
attracted to you as when I'm looking at
you being so kind to someone and I say,
"What a great person you are and I just
want to come and and I run over and I
want to hug you and I want to hold you."
That's attraction, too, right? We're not
just talking about the attraction to
have sex with somebody. Attraction is is
in a in a is part of a story. It's part
of a context. You know, if you think
that you're just going to watch Netflix
for three hours, scroll on your phone
for another two, and then turn around
and say, "Oh, you're so attractive and
I'm so turned on by you." We you're
you're off. You're off. This is not the
way that it works. And then it's easy to
replace the person and to just think
you're, you know, new shiny object. We
will be very attracted again. But
attraction is a part of an interaction
that these two words have the have the
same ethmological root if there is zero
interaction. Now if you have a partner
who neglects themselves, a partner who
you know there's lots of things that
people also do that diminishes them.
There was a woman in a in in a
an event I just did and you know there
had been some hurt in the relationship
and so she said I'm no longer attracted
which is not the same as I have no
desire. Basically she had no desire
and she said but I've worked we've
talked everything out. We've discussed
it. I said yeah you may have discussed
it but your body shut down. Your body
carries the anger. Your body carries the
hurt. Your body carries the feelings.
and your body doesn't want to open. So
obviously it's not over,
you know. So that's too is attraction.
It is one of the most popular things
that men whisper to me in silence, which
is they can't seem to get their and
listen, I'm saying men because my the
majority of my good friends that would
whisper to me are men. So it might be
the case for women too. I just can't
speak to that. is that they are unsure
how they could possibly be faithful for
a prolonged period of time
um and have one partner for a prolonged
period of time. I think that you would
be an interesting thing to tell your men
friends.
Women get bored with monogamy much
sooner than men.
Really? Yes. That's not what men think.
No. men think she's not interested in
sex
and what they should probably replace it
with is that she's not interested in the
sex she's can she's going to have
in order to want sex it needs to be sex
that is worth wanting
for women to remain interested it needs
to be interesting
and so the fact that women don't
necessarily experience the same
liberties at least historically and
culturally all over the world that men
do. So they remain in their homes and
they are not as unfaithful because
there's been a double standard around
infidelity forever everywhere in the
world. For this particular friend of
mine, where is that message? What what
should I say to him when he says, "How
can you be satisfied with one sexual
partner?" That's literally just so you
know that I'm not just I believe you.
But some people at home might think that
it's like me as a proxy of um but but
maybe you're not. Maybe you're not.
Maybe you want to have more partners.
Maybe you want your partner to have
other partners, too. That's not always
so the case, right? He doesn't want to
lose her. That's right. They've been
together I think 25 years. So, you know,
it won't you may have sometimes
frustrations if you there's a few
options, right? You either say we have a
relationship that can welcome other
people. We're not exclusive. But she's
going to leave then
because she doesn't want that. Okay. So
then the next thing is as best as you
can make it as interesting and as fun
and as pleasurable as it can be. And my
first question to you is have you been
doing the same old for god knows how
many years? And with that in mind I
wouldn't be surprised that you're not
that attracted or that she's not that
interested for that matter.
So if you want to be satisfied or more
satisfied,
I mean you have a dialogue you know and
the more satisfied means
bring more of yourself and and and make
this experience more erotic, more
pleasurable, more playful, more
fulfilling.
You may remain frustrated and you may
say I would love to have other people
and for that matter maybe your partner
wants would would want it too but that's
not the kind of relationship that she
wants. That doesn't mean she hasn't
thought about other people and it
certainly wouldn't mean that if she
fantasizes she fantasizes about you. So
everybody is keeping their secrets here
you know. Um, and then the next thing
is, are you putting more emphasis on the
fact that you're not as satisfied having
one sexual partner, or are you putting
more focus on the fact that you're going
to make this sexual experience with your
partner as pleasurable and rich as can
be? If you find yourself more on the
complaining side, then you're going to
be constantly more unsatis dissatisfied.
I think much of it is actually he and
many others want the best of all worlds.
And in life, we're not willing to accept
trade-offs. Yeah. So, and you're saying
you're saying make a decision. If you
want that life, then be honest about
that life. If you don't want that life,
then
invest in that thing to make it better.
Yeah. That's the other alternative. Be
bored with the food you eat. Go buy
other food and and and and cook at home
and make it more rich and more
interesting. If you don't want to have
the same dinner every night in the
house, the question is what are people
doing to make their relationships more
vibrant, more erotic, more alive? I mean
this is really you by the way it's not
about having more sex. You can have more
sex and and not feel much. It's about
making it more alive and vibrant. That
is what much of my work is about is
cultivating the eroticism and the
aliveness in relationships
on the on the personal front. And you
ask people what do you do to make it
rich and interesting and and you find
the laziness, the complacency, the
constant same old same old and then the
complaint about it and then you say that
is that is really self-defeating. Are
you frustrated with people as No, I
smile at it. I I I I just I I smile at
the the way that we can lie to
ourselves.
I smile at the way we can complain about
others and as if that we have no
implication. I smile at the way we don't
want to take responsibility for actually
getting the things that we really want.
You must see the same patterns over and
over again. those ones I do not all but
this kind of pattern which is actually
why I've expanded to from only working
in the romantic sphere to working also
in the workplace because relationships
are richer than just this and I think
that this friend I would have a five
minute conversation with him and I would
ask him these very questions
I would ask the partner also those very
questions
and I would have a few ideas. It's not
uber complicated. You going to record me
to him? No, I'm just Okay.
What would you say to him? What's his
name? I I should call it name. Let's
call him John. John.
So, yes, John. It's we are we are not
necessarily uh curious only about one
partner. Many people would like to have
other partners. in the context of your
relationship that is not an option for
you as I understand. So if that is the
situation and you really deeply care
about your partner and your relationship
with her, then the next question is
what do you do to energize your
relationship to bring playfulness,
curiosity, imagination,
eroticism as in life force, as in
aliveness, not as in sex to your
relationship? Are you bringing the
leftovers home and the best of yourself
goes to work or are you also bringing
your creativity, your energy, your
curiosity to your relationship? My sense
is that if you do that, there is a good
chance that you will actually have a
more satisfying erotic connection with
your partner. That doesn't mean you
won't have interest, curiosity,
fantasies about others, but it will free
you from this position in which you just
kind of say, "I'm bored. I'm not
satisfied. I would like a little more
diversity." And all of that. And just
for you, do not imagine that you're the
only one in your relationship who thinks
this way and wants this. It's just that
you may have a partner who doesn't want
the consequences of it. That doesn't
mean she wouldn't fantasize about the
plurality herself.
I'm going to send that. Um, please
listen
to the ad hoc intervention.
Yeah. Just need a honest response. Have
you ever done that
on your podcast? And Pel said, "Women
are often more quickly bored with
monogamy than men." And that is the
secret that people do not understand.
That means that in order for her to
remain engaged, it has to remain more
engaging and interesting and fun and
pleasurable. And if it's just to get it
done and just to do it for the sake of
doing it, then she really can often
spare it. And while men are much more
able to remain actually contrary to what
he describes to remain interested that
doesn't mean they don't want others as
well but they can remain more interested
in their partner without having to
change it like that. And it is
interpreted as women are less interested
in sex rather than women need more in
order to remain interested. They need
more of the emotional stuff. Not
necessarily. Not only they need more
imagination, more risque, more
connection, more attention, more of a
lot of whatever is hurt thing. Right.
Okay. It's it's one of the the most
important things I learned actually that
that kind of turned it around for me
because once you begin to look at it
like that, it it plays with this classic
gender division. Men want, women
doesn't. It's boring. It's it's like it
becomes true just because we say it all
the time, but that doesn't mean it is.
This is true for a lot of these gendered
things. Um, so my friend replied and the
essence of what they said, yes, he said,
"She's right. Full stop. The intimacy in
our relationship has died and it died so
long ago that I think part of me doesn't
feel like I can revive it anymore. We're
so used to the relationship being off."
Okay, put the put the mic on. Okay.
Yep. All right, John, here's what I
would suggest. Um, I think that you can
just simply say I, you know, Steve
approached me and asked me if I had a
question for Estelle and I just threw
out this thing. At first I was just kind
of flippant about it. I just thought
what do you do when you you know but in
fact when she answered I realized you
know that this is a bigger thing between
us and this is an emptiness and a gap
that we allowed to create and that I
have contributed to and I don't just
want to leave it at that. So I thought
I'm going to sit down and actually write
to you. I want to just write some of my
thoughts because uh I think when we sit
we avoid the subject, we circle around
it or I avoid it or I'm defensive about
it or anyway whatever it is that I've
done. I don't know you enough, John, to
know the details of that. And then you
just really say, you know, something
died a long time ago and I feel awkward
about it, but I miss it and I miss you
and I miss us. And I would like to know
if you are willing to re-engage with me
and for us to rekindle. It's desire goes
through intermittent eclipses. It's like
the moon. It disappears, but it can
reappear. And I would love to invite you
to re-engage with me to bring back the
light, the spark inside of us because we
can do it. We are more than just this.
And because just living side by side, I
don't think is going to be enough for
either of us. And I'm prepared to do my
part. Would you be willing to do yours?
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful. And then let's see
if it still answers us before we end.
I made the biggest investment I've ever
made in a company because of my
girlfriend. I came home one night and my
lovely girlfriend was up at 1:00 a.m. in
the morning pulling her hair out as she
tried to piece together her own online
store for her business. And in that
moment, I remembered an email I'd had
from a guy called John, the founder of
Standstore, our new sponsor and a
company I've invested incredibly heavily
in. And Standtore helps creators to sell
digital products, courses, coaching, and
memberships all through a simple
customizable link in bio system. And it
handles everything, payments, bookings,
emails, community engagement, and even
links with Shopify. And I believe in it
so much that I'm going to launch a Stan
challenge. And as part of this
challenge, I'm going to give away
$100,000 to one of you. If you want to
take part in this challenge, if you want
to monetize the knowledge that you have,
visit stephenbartlet.stan
stan.store to sign up and you'll also
get an extended 30-day free trial of
Stan Store if you use that link. Your
next move could quite frankly change
everything. Are you hearing a lot of
couples in your practice increasingly
say either member of the couple that
they don't like having sex?
Not more than before. I wrote a book 20
years ago that was all about the dilemas
of desire. You've always heard it. I
always heard it. No, I don't think that
there are fundamental changes around
that. I think the changes are the fact
that people are spending less for time
together where they are actually
attentive to each other. They're half
there. Their attention is fragmented.
They're multitasking all the time. The
that's what is changing. And if you have
less connection, less attention, less
intimacy, less in why do you think that
people are suddenly going to be turned
on? But is the sex getting less
interesting? No. Their life with each
other is less interesting.
And this the last time when I spoke to
you like this, you told me why you
shouting at me.
Their life is less interesting. The sex
is the is the consequence of of seven
other things before. God, they haven't
said anything interesting to each other.
They haven't laughed. They haven't
kissed each other. They haven't looked
at each other. They haven't barely
touched each other. And suddenly the
text the sex needs to be you know all
hot and and and and passionate on what
freaking basis.
Their life is not interesting.
Their communication, their interaction,
their conversations, their attention to
each other, the fact that they matter,
the fact that their presence means
something in each other's lives, that's
what is all connected to long-term sex.
Long-term sex doesn't come just for
because you I look at you and I'm and
I'm all hot.
it it it's a different mechanism.
So you're asking a question that happens
here and I am telling you if all of this
is rather boring and uh unengaged.
It's like at work you know I'm doing a
lot of this stuff around work now. It's
like if the engagement is low on what
basis do we think people are going to
perform?
The performance is here, but the
performance is a response to the
engagement, which is a response to the
culture, which is a response to the
quality of the relationships between the
people who work together. It's the same
in the personal realm.
What element of responsibility do I have
in making sure that my relationship with
myself is great in order to have a great
relationship with someone else? Cuz a
lot of people like to blame. I think the
premise is inaccurate. Okay, fix my
premise. The premise is that it it's
time for us to begin to question the
intense level of individualism
and self
thinking, self-love, self-care,
self-fululfillment, self-awareness. It's
all about the self in front. And the
presumption is that if all those levels
of the self have been attended to, we
will be better able to attend to other
people. So, what do you think about this
culture of self-care and self-love? And
I think it's gone overboard.
I think it's it's a distortion.
I think it feeds consumerism. I think
that there's a lot of elements of it
that are highly important. But we have
completely lost the fact that what
actually is at the root of well-being,
happiness, longevity, meaning is in our
relationships and our connections with
others as well as with ourselves. When
you give to others, you will depressed.
When you are when you feel like you make
a difference in other people's life, it
makes you feel better chemically too. If
you go on the street and you make some
you give compliments to people and you
tell them that they look really great or
this this beautiful what they're wearing
and you've made a smile on someone's
face, your oxytocin levels go up too.
Doing for others makes us feel better
about ourselves as well. Not all the
time and not every circumstance but that
voluntary connecting and and and being
engaged with other people whereas being
engaged with oneself. Have you seen at
the gym how people are super engaged
with themselves lifting and but nobody's
interacting with anybody.
And many of these people go home and
there's nobody there. Huh? It's not like
they're doing this for someone that
that's waiting for them. Relating to
yourself is not a goal in and of itself.
It is a step to something, but it's not
in and of itself an achievement. The
goal is relating to others.
The goal is is yes, is having meaningful
relationships, meaningful connections
with other people and other causes that
are beyond yourself. Part of why we are
so miserable and so unhappy and so is
because we are so constantly focused on
ourselves.
There's a world, there's nature, there's
politics, there's climate, there's
people, there's poverty, there is a ton
of things to be interested in. There's
art, there's creativity, there's a lot
of things that are beyond us that is
beyond maximizing and optimizing and
hacking and focusing on myself and naval
gazing.
And I am a therapist and I work with
individuals who I am helping to have a
better relationship with themselves and
deal with what stands in the way to
relate to others not what stands in the
way to feel good about me period. With
gender roles reversing, have you seen
men get increasingly emasculated by the
success of women in your practice? And
have you seen also the woman get sort of
frustrated with the man because he's now
not the bread winner? There was this
stat I saw that said again rough numbers
70% of women expect the man to be the
bread bread winner. But then there's
this bigger social narrative that
actually no 50/50 or you know equality
is the case. Um and I was sat here with
a guy who runs runs the men and boys
clinic. I think it's called the men and
boys institute or something. Richard
Reeves. Mhm. and Richard Reeves was a
stay-at-home dad and then his partner,
you know, and doing all of this work
about men in equality that, you know, a
self-proclaimed feminist, I believe, and
then his wife turned around to him one
day and was like,
you know, and I've heard this quite a
lot. I've heard from my successful
female friends that part of the reason
they think they can't find a man is that
men feel emasculated by their success.
And on the counterpoint, I'm wondering
if it goes the other way. Can I take
this a little differently? Sure, please.
Whatever. Emasculation is a word that
doesn't exist in the feminine.
It's always been a masculine concern.
Which is part of why I said to you that
masculinity is an identity that
constantly has to prove itself. Mhm. If
it was so solid, it wouldn't have to
constantly have to show you that it
really is serious and it's it's the real
thing. There is, you know, those things
do not translate on the feminine side.
The word loser doesn't exist in the
feminine either.
And this is historical. This is not new.
That men have had the challenge with
powerful women is not new. that women
have wanted men to be both powerful and
nurturing is not new. That fathers have
often been as tender toward their I
think that there's a the for me the the
the engagement with some of your
question is that it plays into a whole
discourse about men and women that at
this point somehow puts them completely
apart.
each one kind of more and more angry at
the other side. And I don't really want
to participate in that. The women are
talking about the useless this and the
men are talking about the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
and I don't find that helpful. People I
don't think it's true.
I think there are fathers and men all
over the world doing everything they can
to save their family, their wives, their
you know it has nothing to do just with
how much they earn. The world is filled
with people who want to give a better
life to their family and to their
children. Men who work day and night in
order to provide. And I think that to
turn this conversation into that section
that in that we are referring to is
true. It exists but it is not a fair
rendering of men, of masculinity, of
fathers, of brothers, of husbands
and of wives.
um that there is a group of women who
are out earning the men. Yes, women have
out earned men for a long time in all
kinds of industries, not just at the
higher levels. Um that men have stay
have not been home as primary parents. I
think gay couples have shown us a whole
new range. It's like it's time to kind
of move on a little bit. Do you know
when you say that we need to know how to
relate to each other? And I think you
said that it starts with being aware of
ourselves.
Is that roughly what you said that it
starts with having a sort of a
self-awareness of yourself? I think that
the it's a constant combination because
what I'm saying is that in order to have
self-awareness, you need to understand
your connection with others. Your
self-awareness is not developed here
alone by myself. You get to know
yourself through your relationships with
people. It is in the presence of another
that we discover ourselves. And this is
in part why I'm asking these questions
because I think for a lot of men, we've
understood who we are by how we relate
and the role we play for others
historically. So like I kind of
understand much of who I am when you see
me with my partner. Yeah. Because I will
grab the door. I will grab the bags. I
will help solve problems in a more
logical like I'm a very like tell me how
to fix it. And you understand the I
understand myself by being how I relate
to her. taking care of her is part of my
identity to me. So in in such a world, I
think the question becomes like what is
it to be what is it to be a man? And if
I don't know what that is, I find it
harder to relate to others. One of the
things I love to do, but that's not on a
societal level. That's me in my work.
when I do retreats, relationship
retreats like we have one that I'm going
to do in in October in Greece and and I
have I do fishbowls and I put all the
men in a fishbowl or all those who
identify as men for that matter and I
have the women just listen the people
around
and for an hour they or more or two they
talk about everything you just brought
up their challenges, their frustrations,
their hopes, their aspirations, their
loss. loses their self-doubt, their
shame, their shadows,
and people listen without judgment,
without opinions, just receive the the
gift of having somebody be willing to
expose themselves like that. It's
extremely moving. It's very beautiful
and you learn a ton. And you learn how
much of your projections are, you know,
standing in the way. how much you you
you make assumptions without really
knowing how hard it is to truly listen.
That's when it becomes to me beautiful,
worthwhile and and things change. Things
become softer and people start to weep
in front of total strangers and you
realize humanity is bigger than gender.
Gender is important, super important,
but there is another layer that is just
our humanity. And at this moment in our
society where there's tons of
uncertainties that connecting on the
human level to me supersedes some of
these gender wars. There's lots of it. I
don't and and I leave it to others to
comment on that. But my work is to
create alternative conversations, better
conversations. Are you hopeful?
Honestly, in those moments I'm very
hopeful. But are you hopeful when they
leave the retreat and they go back onto
the algorithms? I hope that some of them
will do that and some of them will
actually experience a profound change
you know but in the moment I feel like I
can do something I'm hopeful when I can
do something when I can contribute when
I can create something that's really
special that's you know I'm not hopeful
when I'm helpless when I'm passive so in
those moments I am hopeful because
something really beautiful is happening
you know when people connect at a deeper
level it is very very meaningful be it
at work or be it at home I mean it it's
anywhere at this point where I can
create these connections people I mean
it's sentence that I take with me all
over the all the time it's the quality
of your relationships will determine the
quality of your lives and my work is
about helping you have better
relationships be more confident be more
connected I I I can analyze a lot of
these statistics but I don't know what
to do with it. Be more confident. Yes.
What is confidence in that regard?
Confidence is when you are able to see
yourself as a flawed person and still
hold yourself in high regard.
That's from my friend Terry Real. But it
is a great definition of confidence.
It's not when I when I know when I'm
sure. It's none of that. It's actually
when I see myself as flawed
but I still hold myself in high regard
that means I'm confident. And is there
is there work one can do to get to such
a place? Yes, of course. Work and life
experience and maturity. But for a lot
of people their work and life experience
knocks them down to make them think
they're just a thought they're just a
flawed person.
That's what I thought when I was in my
20s and 30s too. And if I made a
mistake, I could obsess about it for 3
weeks. Now it's 3 hours, sometimes 3
days if it's really bad. But you know,
you do you you learn to accept you make
mistakes and life goes on and you try
again. So there's no shortcut to No, no,
no, no. Is there anything that builds on
itself? The nice thing about it is that
it builds on itself.
It adds layer by layer, step by step. Is
there anything one can do to accelerate
that process? Why?
So that we can become more confident
quicker. No, that's called arrogance.
When a when a when a 22 year old, you
know, sometimes it's arrogant. I mean
there listen, there are things you can
feel confident about very early on and
and you've tried them. And then there's
other things. It's also not I am
confident. I'm confident about certain
things. You can trust me on some things.
You should not trust me to get you to a
certain place. neither on time, neither
without getting lost. So I have zero
confidence in that area, but I'm quite
confident in some of the things that I
do. And confidence doesn't mean that I
know or that I'm right.
It's that I'm prepared to do things and
be mistaken and not know and try again.
Two different people can go through the
same experience and one of their
confidence can build and the other one
can lose confidence. Yes, that is the
biggest mystery question. Why two people
with the same story? For one, it becomes
what brings their resilience and what
gives them the drive and what makes them
be people that are engaged with life and
the world. And for the other person,
it's what broke them. It's what crushed
them. It's what that makes it so
impossible for them to actually put one
foot in front of the other. And if you
can ever tell me why this and versus
that, you know, why this person to it is
one of the great mystery questions for
any therapist for that matter in
general. Why the same circumstances
build the strength of one and become the
weakness of the other. There's clearly
some kind of a pair of sunglasses in
between what happened and how I
perceived it or something. There must be
some I you know there's a lots of things
but what we do know is that for many
people who have major adverse
circumstances but manage to turn use
them and turn them and and really make a
beautiful life for themselves. It
usually there was one defining factor
that differentiates them from everybody
else who had similar circumstances is
that they had somebody who believed in
them.
a coach, a teacher, a neighbor, not
necessarily a family member actually
because the adversity is often in the
family. So, somebody who believed in you
when you didn't believe in yourself and
didn't give up even when you were
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. I had um a lady called Dr.
Lisa Feldman on the podcast recently
who's a neuroscientist and one of the
things she said to me has really stayed
with me and I think about it a lot and I
talk about it a lot which is um she said
to me she told me the story of a young
lady who grew up and had some uh an
aggressive uncle who would like beat her
and this young lady she was good in
school she slept well everything was
fine and then many years later this
young lady was watching Oprah Winfreyy's
show and it was about domestic abuse and
there was women on there crying and
talking about their trauma and all those
things and essentially this young lady
suddenly started to experience the
symptoms of trauma. Mhm. Unproductive in
education, couldn't sleep as well and
visibly traumatized. The trauma hadn't
appeared hadn't there was wasn't
symptomatic up until she watched this
show with Oprah. And it made me think
that is there a possibility that some of
our trauma not all of it but some of it
like contagious i.e. We give meaning to
it when someone tells us the meaning of
what happened to us
like are we giving meaning to the things
that happened to us and it goes to what
we were saying here about you can go
through the same two thing but interpret
it differently do we inherit the meaning
externally from somewhere you know it's
interesting because I think about this a
lot with things like anxiety I'm like it
feels like you know I know the world has
changed and we're less connected but it
does feel like
had I not known that anxiety existed, I
probably I'm unsure whether I I would
have personally experienced it. I think
that the anxiety culture actually kind
of made me anxious. It made me label the
feeling. And I'm just wondering if you
have a perspective on this idea that we
like give meaning to
our experience and then that yes of
course all the time we give meaning to
everything. We are meaning making
machines and if you don't do an
individual meaning attribution you get a
collective cultural social attribution.
In our society we may call it anxiety.
In another society we may call it the
ancestors are unhappy.
Somebody is a spirit is knocking at your
door. Somebody has not been properly
mourned. Somebody is being um degraded.
So, so there's every every ill ease,
every disease
has a story, has a meaning, has an
attribution.
The words change.
That's on a cultural level. I think it's
very important to not just individualize
these things and think I give meaning.
You we give the meaning that our culture
has taught us to give. You've learn you.
So, you've kind of become you're part of
the anxiety generation. So you put you
give words of anxiety, stress, burnout.
There's a whole lingo that is that
didn't exist 40 years ago by the way. I
mean those words existed but they were
not nearly in the vernacular of the
moment. They were not part of the
therapy speak of dour you know they were
not on Tik Tok. So there were other
words that were people used and you know
every century has certain names.
Hysteria we don't hear much about
hysteria these days. That was a 19th
century thing. It's mental health now,
you know. So, we changed the words, but
we still are trying to give meaning to
our
ill ease. I guess this is a question of
identity as well, which is who do I
think I am? And who I think I am will
probably become who I am, at least as it
relates to relating to people. No, no.
Who do you think you are is part of who
you are and how other people see you is
also a part of who you are. We are
constantly looking at ourselves from the
inside and from the outside.
We do not exist without the inter in
integration of also the gaze from the
outside in. And it's a two-way street
all the time. So if I think I'm a late
person, you said, you know, get there on
time. Um, then I'm likely to be late
off more because I can I've identified
with that becomes part of my character.
It starts to become how I predict my
future. And Lisa Filmore was saying to
me that the brain is this prediction
machine. So it's like predicting um what
to what it will do next based on the
past. So my identity is like a
prediction of what I'll become. And you
know, same I think of this maybe the
same in relationships. Your behavior may
be a prediction but that doesn't mean
your identity.
Don't confuse identity with behavior.
It's it's it's they are connected but
your identity is a lot more than your
behavior.
You know at GFK there are three lines at
the airport. Yeah. One is for the
tourist, one is for the American
passport holder and one is for the
resident alien.
The tourist may have been living in the
states for years, but they don't have
the papers. So the internal definition
is not recognized by the external. The
American, you may have been living your
whole life abroad, but you were born in
the US. So you have the papers, you have
the external recognition, but the
internal one doesn't match. And then the
resident alien is the one who has been
there a long time but doesn't have the
is a guest of some sort right um and I
find that a fascinating moment to
understand identity when you stand there
what is internal what is external what
is seen from other how others recognize
you and think and how others define who
you are and how you define who you are
and these these are conversations
that the question that you're asking
about trauma is a whole it's a different
question because
the trauma is not the event itself.
The trauma is often in the experience of
the event without an empathic witness
without in it. Yes. Without what makes
an event traumatic is often the fact
that you experience something without an
emphatic witness.
Well, it's not the fact that the the the
you it's not the event itself. And so
what happens is she sees this Oprah show
and it's not just that she sees the
women tell their stories but she sees
Oprah with her unique kind of empathy
respond to the women and give value to
their experience and acknowledge it and
express the sadness that comes with it
and the devastation that they may have
experienced. And she she is the
consumate empathic witness who gives not
just meaning to your story but because
before you can give meaning you even
have to acknowledge it. Mhm. You have to
recognize that it even happened. And in
many of those situations it's the lack
of acknowledgement that is the most
traumatic. Not the thing itself
or not only the thing itself the fact
that nobody even admits that this took
place. So as she's watching this
empathic resonance in front of her,
something opens inside of her that
allows her to finally
recogn cry, you know, her do her own
acknowledgement and realize what was
done to her.
That's a different way of interpret and
I have no idea if that is true. But just
to give you another reading of what may
have happened to this woman. Mhm. And
for a while she will not sleep. And for
a while she because suddenly
in order to finally come to admit
something you need to feel safe to let
it happen. And when you watch the opera
show with those women this is I just did
the opera. So I I had the people and I
see how she it's it's an amazing moment
of being held and experiencing a
container that allows you to experience
the pain that you've been holding in.
interesting.
I I was it's a very interesting um
alternative perspective especially this
idea of this the empathic witness and
the minute you see empathy shown to your
experience um in such a way yeah maybe
you have permission to feel in a way
that you didn't get to feel but also in
that environment I imagine there was a
studio audience and they were providing
empathy and there was Oprah and they
were providing empathy and then you had
someone she could relate to who in that
scenario was
being held and had a label like an
implicit label attached to their
experience. But she does it without
audience now. And um it's it's I think
it was a long time ago. So when she used
to have her show many decades ago, I was
my first time on the opera show in ' 87.
87 with a studio audience. Yeah. How was
it? It wasn't
a very powerful experience for a woman,
a young woman as I was back then. It was
just like what? Yeah. This is quite
embarrassing for me to admit. But if you
know me well, there's something that you
know about me which is a function of my
personality and that is that I lose
everything. I've lost my wallet. I've
lost multiple passports. I now actually
have two passports because there's a
high probability of me losing one. And
when you lose your wallet overseas, as I
have many times, it's a particular
inconvenience because you also lose your
driving license and your credit cards
and those kinds of things. And that's
why I'm so happy that our show sponsor
Extra have invented this thing I have in
my hand. They have partnered with
Apple's Find My Technology. So, all I
have to do is open their app and play a
noise and it will tell me where my
wallet is. Extra wallets are slim.
They're made of recycled aluminium and
they block various types of digital
theft. And with one click, your cards
can pop up and are ready to go. So, if

marketeers keep making this mistake.
They're chasing volume instead of
quality. And when you try to be seen by
more people instead of the right people,
all you're doing is making noise. But
that noise rarely shifts the needle and
it's often quite expensive. And I know
as there was a time in my career where I
kept making this mistake that many of
you will be making it too. Eventually, I
started posting ads on our show sponsors
platform, LinkedIn. And that's when
things started to change. I put that
change down to a few critical things.
One of them being that LinkedIn was then
and still is today the platform where
decision makers go to not only to think
and learn but also to buy. And when you
market your business there, you're
putting it right in front of people who
actually have the power to say yes. And
you can target them by job title,
industry, and company size. It's simply
a sharper way to spend your marketing
budget. And if you haven't tried it, how
about this? Give LinkedIn ads a try. and
I'm going to give you a $100 ad credit
to get you started. If you visit
linkedin.com/diary,
you can claim that right now. That's

So, if I made you president of the
entire world and your job was to prevent
the the social atrophy, this decay of
social connections and relationships and
you had to take three steps on a global
basis to they can be drastic steps. You
can delete mobile phones. Oh god. They
can be any drastic step you want to
take. I think that things are lived in
the details, not in the big things.
Okay? You know, where was I recently? I
went to a place and I remember making
the comment. Everybody says hello.
People said hello. People were friendly
when you when you went into a place,
when you were on the street, when you
went it was like I said, "Oh my god, I
have I I have not been in a place." It
felt small enough but it wasn't small
where people kept saying hello have a
nice day this looks very good you know
so it's that basic you make it a law you
have to say no I don't legislate these
things at all I think it's more of a of
a it's a cultural shift it's a it's a
return to to to practices that still are
prevalent in many other parts of the
world talking to strangers Yes. Talking
to strangers. Okay. So, you're going to
make it illegal. It's an incredible
thing to talk to strangers. Um, so
Esteel makes it illegal not to talk to
strangers during illegal. No. No. I said
don't bring the law into it. It's much
more art than law. Anybody who these
days can make people laugh or sing
together is doing holy work.
So go sing with people or go because
when you sing together you create you
create a collective resonance. You you
actually are bringing that resonance
that it is very empathic. It's very
kind. It's compassionate. It's caring.
It's playful. It brings out a whole set
of other things in people.
And the third thing would be teach
people how to have conflict. You asked
me before when when when when you argue
with your with your partner. I think I
think that the the majority of our
arguments are about three basic things.
And this is based on on Howard Markman's
work, but you know, it's not the issue
you're fighting about.
Actually, what you can often ask is what
is it that you're fighting for? And what
people fight for when they argue
whatever thing they're having a spat
about. They fight for power and control.
Who makes the decision? And whose
priorities matter most? They fight for
trust, for care and closeness. Can I
trust you? Do you have my back? Can I
lean on you? Can I rely on you? Will you
show up for me? And they fight for
respect and recognition. Do you value
me? Do I matter? And does this all
translate to work? You've you've now
started doing a lot more work with
businesses and companies around sort of
their working culture and connection and
relationships in the workplace. All of
those things you just listed there, are
they also the reasons why our
relationships are successful or
unsuccessful in a work environment?
Absolutely. So I actually have been
working with corporations and in the
business world for quite a while um and
have been talking in and speaking in for
with corporations and companies. What is
new is that I I became an advisor to a
number of companies in particular in
this case with culture amp and and the
reason that became such a wonderful
collaboration is because I brought my
clinical expertise and they're bringing
massive amounts of data science people
science 1.5 billion experience survey
points. I mean it's just like so it's
not no longer just my intuitive sense.
It's backed. It's
And we created this card game because my
original card game, people wanted the
corporate was demanding for it, but
every time they had to take out the
cards with the pink triangles, which
were the sex questions in order to make
it work safe,
safe for work. So I said, "Okay, let's
create a game just for the workplace
that will create meaningful
relationships at work." And what's
fascinating is that what the research
showed is that there are four major
relational pillars that actually sustain
this quality of relationships in the
workplace and they are directly
connected to these three things that I
said we fight for. So one was trust, one
was belonging. Okay. So on trust, how do
I know what what is trust in specific
terms? What does that mean? Trust is a
leap of faith.
Trust is a sense that that is really
it's an active engagement with the
unknown says Rachel Butsman. It's like
trust is not I know for sure. Trust is I
don't know for sure and I'm willing to
believe it. And that's the definition of
the word trust. And in a work context,
what does that mean? It means that I can
rely on you. Yeah. On my team. Yeah. On
my manager.
um that you uh you have my back. Yeah.
That you're not going to betray me.
You're not going to put your interests
ahead of mine. You are not going to take
credit where the when it's not yours. Um
that you care about me and that we are
part of something together. So trust
then connects directly to a sense of
belonging that we are part of a group of
a company and in and I get a certain
sense of who I am by virtue of my sense
of connection to this group and the
group defines me and gets my
contribution. So it's a mutual
experience. Mutuality is essential to
living organisms be it in nature or in
social ecological systems. And there is
recognition means that there is respect
that I feel valued that I feel that my
that I contribute and that it is
recognized. This is essential because I
could achieve and perform and meet the
productivity goals and all of that but
if nobody pays attention to it, it
doesn't really meet the need. But the
biggest one is the collective
resilience. To me, that's the one that
really stands out because
resilience isn't an individual matter
only. It's not just a set of traits that
exists inside of you and that you need
to tap into in order to face adversity
and all of that. Resilience is how we at
this point in particular are able to
respond creatively and adaptively and
flexibly to all the changes that are
happening. The workplace is in massive
flux, massive flux. And from a
relational point of view, it's huge. And
it is basically at this point becoming
no longer just a soft skills. It's
becoming the new bottom line. Basically,
Esther, thank you so much. Thank you so
much for the work that you do. I I when
I've met you the first time, I was
convinced that you're in fact an alien
from another planet because you have an
ability to understand situations.
um at a deeper, more intuitive level
than anyone I've ever met. Specifically
as it relates to just like the human
condition and the way that we are, the
excuses to make the patterns of a human
and it really like shocked me. You were
able to see through me in a way that I
did not like,
but I appreciate it. Um and it's really
remarkable. There's very few people I've
ever met that are like that that have
that ability. It's a really really
special thing. Um, and it's been the
cause of so much healed and cured and
fixed problems for so many of us. We
have a tradition on this podcast where
the last guest leaves a question for the
next guest, not knowing who they leave
it for. The question left for you is,
how are you going to adapt to a world of
AI and robots?
I am going to uh
use AI as a tool as I just did an hour
before I came here. I was in a meeting
and we were generating ideas and uh and
one of us asked the AI uh exactly this
uh what would you see is the next step
in the collaboration between what would
be bold collaborations between Estelle
Purel and Culture AMP the very company
that with whom I created the cards and
the AI gave us incredible ideas but it
was both we had AI and we had the
people. The people could use the AI, the
AI became way more relevant because it
had the people. So, as long as I can use
it as a tool
um to foster the communication and to
generate ideas and between me and
others, I think that um
I am still shaping it and it is helping
me. I would hope that it doesn't just
begin to shape me or us all and make us
into a species that none of us can yet
imagine.
Some people are very much looking
forward to that new species. I kind of
like the ones we've been.
We imperfect creatures. We're
unpredictable.
But there is something fascinating about
human beings that has been the core of
my work. Thank you. Again, I'll link the
cards below for everyone to go and get a
pair. I think I'm I think I'm going to
use them in at the very start of the
week with my teams. So, just to kind of
create a bit of a space where we can
connect with each other before we get
into more difficult work, but also
there's other sort of work environments
when I have new investments and stuff
like that. It's really, you can do it
one-on-one, you can do it on boarding,
you can do it offsite, but there is
something about the weekly meeting, all
hands on deck kind of meeting where we
do a card, one person each and I can
tell you and especially when it's
remote, which you are not. Yeah. But
there everybody knows the the the
lackluster attention that you can get in
a Zoom meeting with everybody doing five
other things at the same time. You just
need to track the eyes.
But once people start to tell stories
like this, people get the others are
interested and are listening. It changes
the whole dynamic. So, uh it's a
beautiful ritual to have your weekly
start with a few cards. Um Esther, thank
you so much for all that you do. So, so
wonderful to see you. I feel like you
you help correct me and uh in an
important way and you do it with such
what was one of them today when you were
talking about the dementia and the
Alzheimer's and that ambiguous loss I
felt I felt that because I think
sometimes
sometimes I um I create that impression
and my one of my ex-girlfriends said
that to me she said even if you're
sitting next to me I feel like you're a
million miles away and I remember
thinking it's such a horrible way to
make someone feel you know and my
girlfriend. It's what a wonderful thing
it is for someone to want your attention
and to want you to hug them and to want
you to care about them and to look at
them. What a wonderful privilege that is
and to like insult that privilege by
being a million miles away. I just
thought this horrible thing it is that
you know how often during the day do you
send just a little sweet nothing? I know
I need to do that more. I don't know. Do
you know how much it changes a person's
Yeah. just to say that you're thinking
about them as well because I do think
about them but I just don't I don't you
know so you're saying it to me. Yeah.
Yeah. Exactly. I need to say it to her.
I'm going to say I'm going to tell her
now Esther. Okay.
Life is lived in the details. It's all
these small things.
It's not it's like when you ask about
the changing of the world. I I don't
think in these big things. And this, you
know, when it's done authentically,
it's not big and it
Yeah. Okay. Okay. That puts energy into
a relationship. She said, "Oh, with a
little heart face." She said,
"Sweetheart."
And she's typing.
Okay, you got it. No, I don't.
The hardest conversations are often the
ones we avoid. But what if you had the
right question to start them with? Every
single guest on the diary of a co has
left behind a question in this diary.
And it's a question designed to
challenge, to connect, and to go deeper
with the next guest. And these are all
the questions that I have here in my
hand. On one side, you've got the
question that was asked, the name of the
person who wrote it, and on the other
side, if you scan that, you can watch
the person who came after who answered
it. 51 questions split across three
different levels. The warm-up level, the
open up level, and the deep level. So,
you decide how deep the conversation
goes. And people play these conversation
cards in boardrooms at work, in
bedrooms, alone at night, and on first
dates, and everywhere in between. I'll
put a link to the conversation cards in
the description below and you can get
yours at the diary.com.
This has always blown my mind a little
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the
show. So, could I ask you for a favor?
If you like the show and you like what

And my commitment to you is if you do
that, then I'll do everything in my
power, me and my team, to make sure that
this show is better for you every single
week. We'll listen to your feedback.
We'll find the guest that you want me to
speak to and we'll continue to do what
we do. Thank you so much.
