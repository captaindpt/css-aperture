Remember the trillion-dollar, 170-kilometer&nbsp;
mirrored city slicing through the Saudi desert?
On September 16th, it was put on trial by&nbsp;
the TEN most powerful men in Saudi Arabia.
The verdict: DEATH.
They carved it up, distributed the assets,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and left the carcass at the foot of Mount Horeb,&nbsp;
the exact mountain where Moses talked to God.
&nbsp;
Hey, I’m Steve, this is Gigaprojects, and&nbsp;
you’re watching the grand finale of our&nbsp;&nbsp;
NEOM trilogy. It’s not what we expected&nbsp;
to show you, but the world moves fast.
First, the cold facts: not a single major&nbsp;
contract has been awarded to NEOM in 2025.
&nbsp;
Remember in Part 2 when we said The Line would&nbsp;
run out of work without new funding? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;
they ran out. The Line’s CDO Hickey and COO&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pendleton have already moved to Trojena&nbsp;
after its CEO Philip Gullett was let go.
And those Vault contractors from Part&nbsp;
2 who begged 'Fund us now or kiss the&nbsp;&nbsp;
2029 Asian Games goodbye?' Well, they were not&nbsp;
properly funded, so the Olympic Committee is now&nbsp;&nbsp;
in talks with China and South Korea about&nbsp;
moving the Asian Games to those countries.
Then our sources confirmed&nbsp;
what our evidence suggested:&nbsp;&nbsp;
The PIF has stopped all work on The Line, Magna&nbsp;
and Sindalah. They're dismantling NEOM: Oxagon's&nbsp;&nbsp;
Green Hydrogen plant goes to Saudi&nbsp;
Aramco. Sindalah goes to Red Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;
Global. NEOM's headquarters moves to Riyadh.&nbsp;
Thousands of international staff—fired.
The Line isn't just dead. It's being erased.&nbsp;
What you saw in Part 1—the transport systems,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the vertical city, the stadium floating&nbsp;
above the Chandelier— that was NEOM's&nbsp;&nbsp;
international staff's last hurrah. Their&nbsp;
final pitch deck before the pink slips.
This feels like the opening of&nbsp;
Sunset Boulevard—where the corpse&nbsp;&nbsp;
floating face-down narrates how he got there.
&nbsp;
Welcome to the autopsy, where our corpse&nbsp;
is still winking at us — mostly dead.&nbsp;
Here’s something to understand about Saudi&nbsp;
culture: Wajh — your face, your reputation — makes&nbsp;&nbsp;
public failure worse than death. MBS will&nbsp;
never announce The Line's cancellation. Not&nbsp;&nbsp;
today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. Not because&nbsp;
he's delusional, but because he's Saudi.
Which means The Line will float in that&nbsp;
pool forever, pretending to be alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;
while everyone pretends not&nbsp;
to notice the bullet holes.
And the most beautiful part? YOU took&nbsp;
part in it. Every render you mocked,&nbsp;&nbsp;
every article you shared, every comment&nbsp;
"it's a prison" —all of it was part of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the act. Because for most of its time&nbsp;
The Line wasn't a construction project.
The Line was misdirection. And&nbsp;
like all great misdirection,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it worked because we wanted to be fooled.
Today, we'll show you how MBS staged the most&nbsp;
expensive vanishing act in construction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;
How he made a trillion-dollar promise disappear&nbsp;
while delivering something nobody saw coming.
And we’ll do it with the help of our good&nbsp;
friends Christopher Nolan and Sir Michael Caine.
Welcome to The Prestige.
&nbsp;
"Every magic trick consists of three&nbsp;
parts or acts. The first part is called&nbsp;&nbsp;
the PLEDGE. The magician shows you something&nbsp;
ordinary... a deck of cards, a bird, or a man."&nbsp;
"Today I'm presenting you The Line, a city with&nbsp;
one million residents with a length of 170km&nbsp;&nbsp;
that preserves 95% of nature within NEOM."
What MBS announced in 2021 was brilliant.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Start with the infrastructure everyone&nbsp;
else leaves for last—a 170-kilometer&nbsp;&nbsp;
metro called The Spine going through a&nbsp;
nature reserve around Moses mountain,&nbsp;&nbsp;
bigger than Serengeti or Yellowstone,&nbsp;
connecting five city-modules:
Red Sea Gateway
Hidden Marina.&nbsp;
Community One.
Community Two.&nbsp;
And at the terminus—NEOM International Airport.
Never mind there's already an airport nearby.&nbsp;
When you're building five cities and need&nbsp;&nbsp;
“something” at the end of your metro line,&nbsp;
you build another airport. Because why not?
Five architect firms. Five cities,&nbsp;
each growing outward from their metro&nbsp;&nbsp;
station. Urban planners loved it. Practical.&nbsp;
Buildable. Everything The Line isn't today.
Then MBS decided "practical" wasn't enough.
Prestige-Clip: In my travels. I have seen&nbsp;&nbsp;
the future. And it is a strange future&nbsp;
indeed. The world, ladies and gentlemen,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is on the brink of new, terrifying possibilities.
Every magician's pledge creates&nbsp;
a reality distortion field,&nbsp;&nbsp;
like that strange future Wolverine was talking&nbsp;
about. Time to make everyone else see it too.
&nbsp;
Enter Hollywood concept artist Olivier Pron,&nbsp;&nbsp;
who’s worked on a bunch of Marvel movies. MBS’&nbsp;
brief was simple: "Make it worthy of Thanos."
This wasn't random—MBS grew up&nbsp;
on Star Wars, Dune, and Marvel.
So all those Star Wars and MCU&nbsp;
references we're making on our&nbsp;&nbsp;
channel? Those are tongue-in-cheek&nbsp;
explanations of MBS's playbook.
Step One: Thanosification
Pron took five horizontal cities,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and folded them like a taco into one&nbsp;
vertical megastructure. The problem is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this compression shrank the city from&nbsp;
170 kilometers to just 4 kilometers—&nbsp;&nbsp;
three modules in a massive man-made&nbsp;
harbor called the Hidden Marina.
Step Two: Wakandafication
But MBS needed to grab the&nbsp;&nbsp;
world’s attention and keep them distracted&nbsp;
or his magic trick wouldn’t work. So what&nbsp;&nbsp;
was presented to the public combined the best&nbsp;
of both worlds: the 170-kilometer length from&nbsp;&nbsp;
the original metro AND the 500-meter walls&nbsp;
from Pron's design. The Line wasn't just&nbsp;&nbsp;
ambitious - it defied physics, economics,&nbsp;
and common sense. It was pure fantasy.
Two parallel glass walls creating a canyon of&nbsp;
mirrors, 500 meters tall, with a floating stadium&nbsp;&nbsp;
and underground transit at 350 kilometers per&nbsp;
hour. Impossible to build. Perfect for headlines.&nbsp;
"He shows you this object, perhaps&nbsp;
he asks you to inspect it...&nbsp;&nbsp;
to see that it is indeed real,&nbsp;
but of course it isn’t.."&nbsp;
Here's what MBS knew from day one: there’s no&nbsp;
way he could stay within his means and still&nbsp;&nbsp;
accomplish his goals. He needed access to all&nbsp;
of the wealth that Saudi Arabia had to offer.
And standing in his way? The&nbsp;
Saudi Public Investment Fund.
Here's how public investment funds are&nbsp;
supposed to work: you bank your oil money,&nbsp;&nbsp;
invest it globally, and live off the&nbsp;
returns forever. The one sacred rule is:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Never touch the principal. You can only spend&nbsp;
the interest - about 50 billion dollars a year.
Fifty billion sounds massive until you price MBS's&nbsp;
shopping list. His solution was pretty audacious:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stop calling them projects. Call them&nbsp;
investments. Because investments can tap&nbsp;&nbsp;
the principal—that's not spending,&nbsp;
that's "reallocation of assets."
The PIF isn’t stupid, so they said&nbsp;
there were two ways he could do this.
The first was: find co-investors&nbsp;
to split the costs and the risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This worked at Oxagon's hydrogen plant&nbsp;
— a joint-venture between Air Products,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Acwa Power and NEOM - so MBS just&nbsp;
needed to make it work for The Line.
They advertised their commitment to&nbsp;
the project with what we're calling the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Big Ditch. A trench across the desert,&nbsp;
perfectly straight, fifty meters wide,&nbsp;&nbsp;
up to five meters deep, and 120,000 meters&nbsp;
long— it’s so big you can see it from space.
This is the view from the&nbsp;
eastern end at the airport.
&nbsp;
As you can see in this timelapse,&nbsp;
from September 2022 to April ’24&nbsp;&nbsp;
they spent hundreds of millions on what they told&nbsp;
engineers was the foundation for the Spine metro,&nbsp;&nbsp;
connecting NEOM International Airport with The&nbsp;
Cantilever — a place which was never formally&nbsp;&nbsp;
announced and existed only on the NEOM homepage.
When we visited in 2024, it was biblical - endless&nbsp;&nbsp;
lines of trucks and excavators. This is how&nbsp;
it looked in the Sharma Valley … and this&nbsp;&nbsp;
is how it looked on the construction&nbsp;
site of Neom International Airport.
&nbsp;
Here's what we discovered&nbsp;
when we returned in 2025:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everything was deserted. Not abandoned —&nbsp;
wrapped up like a movie set after filming.
Look, you don't dig the foundation&nbsp;
of a 150-kilometer railway from&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nowhere A to Nowhere B in eighteen&nbsp;
months and then just pack it up.
Real infrastructure doesn't work&nbsp;
that way. Marketing campaigns do.
But the important question is -&nbsp;
Did it work? Boy howdy did it!&nbsp;
It got tens of thousands of news articles,&nbsp;&nbsp;
YouTubes, and Twitter threads -&nbsp;
which was exactly the point. It&nbsp;&nbsp;
was the world's longest billboard advertising&nbsp;
to investors: "Look! We're really doing this!&nbsp;
And the investors loved it! Fifty hedge-funds&nbsp;
invested hundreds of billions of dollars!
Nah, just joking. The Big Ditch&nbsp;
was a big swing-and-miss. When&nbsp;&nbsp;
the investors didn't bite, the&nbsp;
construction crews packed up.
So MBS had to try something else.
"The second act is called the TURN.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The magician takes the ordinary... and&nbsp;
makes it do something extraordinary."
&nbsp;
The NEOM version of the Turn? Making a&nbsp;
700 billion dollar petroleum fund pay for&nbsp;&nbsp;
500 billion dollars in dreams,&nbsp;
and that’s not counting The Line.
The second way the PIF said he&nbsp;
could treat the gigaprojects&nbsp;&nbsp;
as investments is if they returned the&nbsp;
same rates as their current investments.
If you can’t find partners, you gotta show&nbsp;
profits. And that’s when the real illusion began.
According to the Wall Street Journal's&nbsp;
deep-dive into a 100-page PIF audit of Trojena:
"We call it a mutual dance of delusion. The&nbsp;
Crown Prince would go to the people running&nbsp;&nbsp;
NEOM and say, 'I want completely crazy&nbsp;
architecture that defies what we know&nbsp;&nbsp;
about how buildings are built,' as though&nbsp;
it could sort of get done realistically.
&nbsp;
...and while that was happening, the PIF demanded&nbsp;&nbsp;
an IRR of 9% for ultra-luxury hotels&nbsp;
when 4% is the industry average.
NEOM's management got caught&nbsp;
in the middle, so they did what&nbsp;&nbsp;
any middle-management would do when facing&nbsp;
impossible demands: They hired consultants!
In 2021 they made a 300 million dollar call&nbsp;
to McKinsey, who brought in PwC. Together&nbsp;&nbsp;
they cooked the books so thoroughly, Gordon&nbsp;
Ramsay would've been impressed, here’s how:
&nbsp;
So you can see this with Trojena&nbsp;
in this fall 2023 document we have,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can see that they had a glamping site.
Glamping like this is sort of what they call&nbsp;
glamorous camping, like sort of fancy tents?
Yeah, and they originally were estimating&nbsp;
that they'd get $216 a night. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
after costs went up, they looked at&nbsp;
it closer and said, "Well, actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we were readjusting that to $704 a night.
How widespread was this practice?
It was common. We've talked to a&nbsp;
lot of people who took part in it.
Every Saudi gigaproject cooked the books,&nbsp;
because 9% IRR is mathematically impossible.&nbsp;
Take Shura Island with its signature&nbsp;
Coral Bloom concept—let’s assume you put&nbsp;&nbsp;
$100 million into building one of the eleven&nbsp;
Foster‑designed hotels which are about to open.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The IRR is interest, so 9%, and is calculated&nbsp;
over 15 years from the day you invest your money.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That means five years ago. Once it opens on&nbsp;
a half-finished island, you’ll spend another&nbsp;&nbsp;
five years troubleshooting operations and paying&nbsp;
influencers to TikTok your resort as the ‘next&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maldives. That leaves just five years to&nbsp;
somehow cough up $256 million in profit.&nbsp;
The only way this works in a virgin destination:&nbsp;
Assume $10,000 a night, booked solid year-round.
This is what actually happened on neighboring&nbsp;
Shebara Island. And you know what you get on&nbsp;&nbsp;
top? MBS as architect. Here’s John Pagano, the CEO&nbsp;
of Red Sea Global explaining the design process.
"His Royal Highness is very intimately involved in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the design process, wanting to drive us to do&nbsp;
things that have never been seen before. He&nbsp;&nbsp;
wanted to create something very different to&nbsp;
anything else in the world. We did design more&nbsp;&nbsp;
conventional hotels and he didn't like them,&nbsp;
you know, and again, he kept emphasizing I&nbsp;&nbsp;
want something that has never been seen before,&nbsp;
which is, if you think about it, very difficult.
But Pagano and architect Shaun Killa kept&nbsp;
iterating until MBS got what he wanted:&nbsp;&nbsp;
shimmering mirror domes floating on the&nbsp;
water like the impound yard for Area 51.
Result? 100 million TikTok views.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, right next door,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Foster + Partners' St. Regis and Nujuma&nbsp;
by Kengo Kuma barely broke 10 million.
Let that sink in. MBS is crushing&nbsp;
Foster and Kuma, the world's greatest&nbsp;&nbsp;
architects — 100 million to 10.
And you know what's never been&nbsp;&nbsp;
seen before? Guests pay 50% extra just&nbsp;
to sleep inside their TikTok video.
Now the reality check: After launching at the&nbsp;
delusional $10,000/night, MBS's viral orbs&nbsp;&nbsp;
still command $3,000. Foster and Kuma? $2,000.&nbsp;
Same amenities. One thousand dollar difference&nbsp;&nbsp;
for viral architecture.
The Pagano interview happened&nbsp;&nbsp;
at Desert Rock — another MBS monument&nbsp;
carved out of bare rock, let’s watch&nbsp;&nbsp;
how he navigated the dance of delusion.
We weren't trying to copy the Maldives or&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Seychelles or Dubai—he wanted&nbsp;
something quintessentially Saudi.
Let’s decode MBS's brief: He&nbsp;
wanted Tatooine from Star Wars.
Just look at George Lucas' Star Wars locations&nbsp;
in Tunisia. That's ancient desert architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And Uncle Owen's moisture farm was&nbsp;
an actual hotel carved from rock.&nbsp;
He's attracted to things that are, you&nbsp;
know, never been seen before. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Desert Rock is another, you&nbsp;
know, manifestation of that.
Hotel rooms carved into a granite mountain,&nbsp;
that's uncle Owen's moisture farm reimagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jabba's palace is Jean Nouvel’s Sharaan reserve&nbsp;
in Al Ula where a mountain is hollowed into&nbsp;&nbsp;
a sanctuary of pure rock and sculpted&nbsp;
light. Diriyah Gate - the original Saudi&nbsp;&nbsp;
capital restored from ruins. Adobe walls, shaded&nbsp;
sikkas, working wind-catchers. This IS Tatooine.
NEOM thought bigger meant better so&nbsp;
they promised Coruscant. But here's&nbsp;&nbsp;
the thing—even Tatooine is brutal to build.
"I looked at Al Ula and thought—the Nabataeans&nbsp;&nbsp;
built those tombs 2000 years ago with&nbsp;
their hands. How difficult can it be? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that mountain is hard granite. When we tried&nbsp;
to excavate, we were breaking equipment."
Pagano carved just one floor&nbsp;
into the granite—enough for&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tiktok—then built regular apartments around it.
Now look at the original from Jean&nbsp;
Nouvel: "C'est le principe des puits,&nbsp;&nbsp;
c'est tout à fait la même chose. Et puis on a la&nbsp;
conscience d'une échelle tout à fait différents"
And this is Neom’s copy: Aquellum which just got&nbsp;
axed for being a money crematorium.You know what's&nbsp;&nbsp;
funny? The royal commission of AlUla will carve&nbsp;
one entrance into the sandstone, call it Jabba's&nbsp;&nbsp;
palace, build Mos Espa villas around it, and still&nbsp;
claim they're building Jean-Nouvel's 'Sharaan.'
'If I show His Royal Highness something and he&nbsp;
likes it, he expects that I can deliver it.'
Pagano's rule: guarantee&nbsp;
delivery, whatever the cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the wooden architecture at Nujuma&nbsp;
and St. Regis, he went Swiss with&nbsp;&nbsp;
Blumer Lehmann. That's like buying a Patek&nbsp;
Philippe to hammer nails. Absurd? Maybe.&nbsp;
All three resorts opened two months EARLY.&nbsp;
In Saudi construction, that's delivering&nbsp;&nbsp;
a unicorn. And when you're racing against&nbsp;
NEOM for first delivery, that's priceless.
Because NEOM's Sindalah Island—also due November&nbsp;
2024—arrived 75% complete and 300% over budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's what triggered NEOM's executive purge&nbsp;
and handed Sindalah to John Pagano. Here’s why:
We didn't hire external consultants to&nbsp;&nbsp;
come and be the delivery. And the&nbsp;
developer, we're the developer.
NEOM started expat-heavy, delivery-focused. But&nbsp;
Saudi CEO Nadhmi Al Nasr also institutionalized&nbsp;&nbsp;
Saudi disease: hire consultants to protect&nbsp;
wajh, not solve problems. When the project&nbsp;&nbsp;
fails, you fire the consultant&nbsp;
publicly, keeping your wajh intact.
But Nadhmi Al Nasr went further: Engineers who&nbsp;&nbsp;
said 'impossible' were fired. Managers&nbsp;
who delivered—poached by Red Sea Global.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is how NEOM became a dream&nbsp;
factory with no delivery department.
What’s worse: Pagano understood what NEOM&nbsp;
never did: They had two masters. For MBS,&nbsp;&nbsp;
he built viral monuments. For the PIF, he&nbsp;
built money printers like Laheq Island.&nbsp;
Today we’re honored with his&nbsp;
Excellency, Yasser Al-Rumayyan,&nbsp;&nbsp;
who is the governor of the Public Investment Fund.
Yes. This is the guy who killed The Line&nbsp;
and Neom. Today he's celebrating what NEOM&nbsp;&nbsp;
should have been, because Red Sea Global delivers.
"Laheq is the first opportunity that many people&nbsp;&nbsp;
will have to own a home on&nbsp;
an island in the Red Sea."
No promises of zero-gravity living. Just, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;
500 villas and 220 condos to&nbsp;
sell and you too can own a home.
"So we came up with this idea of&nbsp;
what if we create a growing system,&nbsp;&nbsp;
a light touch development, a series&nbsp;
of repeatable modules, garden modules&nbsp;&nbsp;
that weave throughout the development. And&nbsp;
it's all about living, immersed in nature."
Translation: "Light touch" and&nbsp;
"Repeatable modules" means they&nbsp;&nbsp;
can build these villas for 500&nbsp;
grand and sell them for 5 million.
Pagano understood that a 9 % IRR works&nbsp;
only when you sell real estate. So he's&nbsp;&nbsp;
developing Saudi's pristine coastline,&nbsp;
selling it off-plan to millionaires,&nbsp;&nbsp;
banking super-profits. The Shebara orbs?&nbsp;
That's the loss-leader that gets you in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the door. The Shura and Laheq villas?&nbsp;
That's where he makes the money back.&nbsp;
Eliot Brown's "mutual dance of delusion" implies&nbsp;
MBS, the PIF and NEOM were equally delusional.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But looking at Pagano makes you think the&nbsp;
delusion was entirely NEOM’s. It makes you&nbsp;&nbsp;
think everyone was dancing on Tatooine while NEOM&nbsp;
was trying to dance on Coruscant. But was it?
&nbsp;
"Now, you're looking for the secret, but&nbsp;
you won't find it... Because, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're not really looking. You don't really&nbsp;
want to know. You want to be fooled."
&nbsp;
And fooled we were. For three years everyone&nbsp;
played along — the consultants, the executives,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the PIF — until March 2024, when the music&nbsp;
stopped, the spreadsheets sobered up,&nbsp;&nbsp;
half of NEOM’s leadership was fired,&nbsp;
and the consultancies were blacklisted.
When the PIF's hand-picked auditors&nbsp;
finally un-cooked the books,&nbsp;&nbsp;
they buried the real damage in the&nbsp;
footnotes of their annual report&nbsp;
Their gigaproject holdings, valued at 241 Billion&nbsp;
Riyal or $64 billion in 2023, fell to just 211&nbsp;&nbsp;
Billion Riyal or $56 billion by 2024—despite&nbsp;
pouring in billions throughout the year.
The annual report also mentions a mysterious $44&nbsp;&nbsp;
billion write-off with zero explanation.&nbsp;
Let's reverse-engineer the real numbers.
According to the PIFs own math (Method 1)
$56B at the end of 2024&nbsp;
$44B write-off
Total invested: $100B
Method 2 (MEED/Emirates tracking):
According to Emirates NBD and MEED projects,&nbsp;&nbsp;
$81 billion in construction contracts were&nbsp;
awarded across the Big five Giga projects&nbsp;
~$20B to smaller Gigaprojects
Total $100 billion.&nbsp;
Let's add the likely write-offs.
- Diriyah has some&nbsp;&nbsp;
expensive hotels. 4 billion. -
- ROSHN, the real estate developer. Zero.&nbsp;
- Qiddiya — Theme parks print money.. Zero.
- Red Sea has some pricey monuments. 4 billion.&nbsp;
- Scattered across smaller&nbsp;
Gigaprojects - 6 billion.
The other 30 must be Neom.
Let’s look at Neom’s write-offs
Infrastructure: 11 billion for the&nbsp;
workers communities plus $4B for the&nbsp;&nbsp;
cancelled spine-tunnel - complete loss
Oxagon—$11 billion for a floating port&nbsp;&nbsp;
city plus a green hydrogen plant for which&nbsp;
they built this year this giant windpark&nbsp;&nbsp;
and this giant solar farm. They sold Neom’s&nbsp;
shares worth $4B to Saudi Aramco. The rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oxagon—the port expansion and strategic&nbsp;
investments continue – $6 billion.
&nbsp;
Trojena - 9 billion to build an artificial&nbsp;
lake and ski-slopes. Write-off: $5 billion.
&nbsp;
Sindalah Island - 3 billion - complete loss
Magna - 1 billion for Aquellum - complete loss.
&nbsp;
And finally The Line - the mother of&nbsp;
all write-offs - where they’ve spent&nbsp;&nbsp;
three hundred and ninety billion dollars&nbsp;
on the megalopolis of the future.
Oh, wait. My bad, I misread that. The audit&nbsp;
revealed each module of the Line would cost&nbsp;&nbsp;
130 billion, not the 50 bil it was budgeted&nbsp;
at. So it would take 390 billion to do the&nbsp;&nbsp;
three modules planned in the first phase&nbsp;
… and that full 170 kilometer dream from&nbsp;&nbsp;
the marketing renders would cost 8.8&nbsp;
t-t-t-trillion dollars. That’s the&nbsp;&nbsp;
GDP of all of the Middle East … AND the&nbsp;
rest of the whole continent of Africa.
&nbsp;
But even if they didn’t outspend a whole&nbsp;
continent, they still spent a crazy amount&nbsp;&nbsp;
of money, right? I mean this is their big&nbsp;
showpiece. Gimme a second to do some math…
Add that plus that, times that, carry the one…
Bringing us to the shocking revelation:&nbsp;&nbsp;
they've only spent 5 billion dollars&nbsp;
on the Line itself. Five bil.
The Line is disappearing in front of our eyes.
"But you wouldn't clap yet... because&nbsp;&nbsp;
making something disappear isn't enough."
Let’s face it. The PIF has won. On all fronts.
They've written NEOM down from $40 billion&nbsp;
to essentially nothing. Maybe $10 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;
remains viable in Trojena and Oxagon.&nbsp;
The rest of Neom? Declared worthless,&nbsp;&nbsp;
sold, or condemned to a state of cryo-sleep.
And despite MBS's grand ambitions, the PIF kept&nbsp;
total gigaproject spending at exactly $100 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;
over five years—never touching the principal,&nbsp;
operating within their means the whole time.
&nbsp;
But MBS had one more card hidden up his sleeve.&nbsp;
We’re calling it the Deadline Doctrine.
&nbsp;
While the books were still cooking, MBS entered&nbsp;
into international contracts that had firm&nbsp;&nbsp;
commitments. Every international deadline put&nbsp;
pressure on the PIF to keep makin’ it rain.
In 2029 they’re scheduled to host&nbsp;
the Asian Winter Games in Trojena,&nbsp;&nbsp;
with contracts signed with the&nbsp;
International Olympic Committee.
In 2030, the Riyadh Expo, with&nbsp;
agreements signed with 180 countries
In 2034, the FIFA World Cup, with eleven&nbsp;
stadiums promised to a billion fans,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and an agreement with FIFA that allows&nbsp;
the hooligans to ignore local laws,&nbsp;&nbsp;
take over and build whatever they&nbsp;
want, and stick Saudi with the bill.
But it wasn’t a blank check. The PIF tried&nbsp;
to fight back with 'value engineering' —&nbsp;&nbsp;
architect-speak for 'make it cheaper.' By&nbsp;
June 2025, their desperation went public.
But based on the multiple sources that we've&nbsp;
spoken to, NEOM has commissioned this RFP to&nbsp;&nbsp;
look at the feasibility of The Line as&nbsp;
it currently stands. One big element,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Joumanna, that NEOM is asking for is&nbsp;
to look at commercializing aspects&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the city and how it could turn into&nbsp;
something that makes business sense.
Think about that. They put&nbsp;
an open bounty on the Line:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Find something, ANYTHING, that could be&nbsp;
downsized, commercialized, or salvaged.
The likely answer was: Nothing.
Because MBS designed everything to be&nbsp;
unshrinkable through all-or-nothing propositions.
Remember what we said in&nbsp;
part-2 about building The Line?
You can only unplug the gap and flood the&nbsp;
Marina after you’ve built the raft foundations,&nbsp;&nbsp;
basements, and super-cores for all three modules.
Only then can they fill the&nbsp;
Marina for cruise ships to&nbsp;&nbsp;
sail in. So let's be clear there's no&nbsp;
phasing that first gigantic footprint.
You can’t build just one module, you have&nbsp;
to build three. You can’t just build one&nbsp;&nbsp;
wall now and one later, because&nbsp;
then the FIFA stadium would hang&nbsp;&nbsp;
in mid-air like Wile E. Coyote&nbsp;
realizing gravity isn’t optional.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The same applies for reducing the height, because&nbsp;
the stadium is above the chandelier. Remember&nbsp;&nbsp;
district four and MBS' trillionaire's palace from&nbsp;
Part 1? According to the Wall Street Journal,&nbsp;&nbsp;
NEOM staff begged MBS to reduce it from 500&nbsp;
to 300 meters tall to save billions. MBS&nbsp;&nbsp;
told the board this was 'inappropriate.'&nbsp;
Cost savings should be found elsewhere.
Every practical option dies&nbsp;
because MBS designed it that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was both The Line's creator and its destroyer.
And we say MBS, because all-or-nothing&nbsp;
propositions are well known in politics&nbsp;&nbsp;
and negotiation, but unknown in&nbsp;
architecture for a good reason:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Architects have no leverage—the&nbsp;
building doesn't exist yet. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
can't threaten people by holding a rendering&nbsp;
hostage. When MBS gave the PIF the ultimatum&nbsp;&nbsp;
'build everything or build nothing,' he forgot&nbsp;
that nothing is always cheaper than something.
Like The Line, Trojena's Kraken and&nbsp;
Vault were designed to be unshrinkable.
We call this the Kraken because 'ski village'&nbsp;
is a serious misnomer – the Kraken is one of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the biggest buildings on the planet, featuring&nbsp;
a ski-able rooftop with 2.3km of slopes as its&nbsp;&nbsp;
tentacles. It's Saudi Arabia's first super sized&nbsp;
building and it’s visibly going vertical. As you&nbsp;&nbsp;
can see they made huge progress over the&nbsp;
last six months, the structural skeleton&nbsp;&nbsp;
is already complete in some sections with&nbsp;
the ski-able rooftop already installed.
The Kraken was designed to&nbsp;
be unvalue-engineerable,&nbsp;&nbsp;
because even at 2400m, it's not reliably cold&nbsp;
enough for a decent three month ski season. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Kraken is essentially a giant slope shaped&nbsp;
refrigerator with a ski resort underneath.
NEOM's USP was breakfast by the sea, lunch in the&nbsp;
mountains. That promise required unprecedented&nbsp;&nbsp;
infrastructure. Visitors would arrive at The&nbsp;
Mirage visitor center on the lower plateau,&nbsp;&nbsp;
then take the Time-Travel Tunnel 3.8km up to the&nbsp;
Vault. This massive transit hub—two interconnected&nbsp;&nbsp;
buildings, 200 meters high, 864 meters long—would&nbsp;
contain apartments, hotels, and a shopping mall.
Remember those contractors from Part 2 with their&nbsp;&nbsp;
desperate pleas? "Act now or&nbsp;
kiss the Asian Games goodbye"?
According to their timeline,&nbsp;
they should be pouring the raft&nbsp;&nbsp;
foundations and erecting the massive&nbsp;
steel cores. Now look where they're&nbsp;&nbsp;
standing now. They're still stuck&nbsp;
in May, while we're in October.
The PIF awarded their contracts. But according&nbsp;
to Vault contractors we’ve talked to,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the PIF ordered them to "slow-walk". Keep billing,&nbsp;
keep workers on site, but build at glacial speed.
The Olympic Committee immediately saw&nbsp;
the implications: a ski resort with no&nbsp;&nbsp;
way to move people? They started&nbsp;
making quiet calls. China? Korea?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anyone interested in hosting the 2029 Asian Games?
In August the Korean Olympic Committee&nbsp;
leaked the story to the press:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Saudi Arabia cannot get their shit together.
MBS thought he was playing 4D chess. The PIF&nbsp;&nbsp;
just flipped the board. They sabotaged the&nbsp;
Asian Games to escape the deadline doctrine:&nbsp;&nbsp;
No Olympics, no deadline.&nbsp;
No deadline, no leverage.
Here's the corpus delicti:
"NEOM's Trojena Ski Village project&nbsp;
will be reopened for the main tender.”
Translation: The PIF is starting over and the&nbsp;
2029 Asian Games will not be happening in Trojena.
It’s likely Saudi’s hosting will be postponed&nbsp;
to 2033 -- so let the value-engineering begin!
The Kraken's frozen tentacles?&nbsp;
One slope will do. The Vault and&nbsp;&nbsp;
public transit? Please—this is&nbsp;
Saudi Arabia, we have G-Wagons.
Look at the PIF's vision for Trojena. See all that&nbsp;&nbsp;
green? That's grass for golf&nbsp;
courses where MBS wanted ice.
Repeat Pagano’s playbook, carpet Moses mountain&nbsp;
with luxury chalets, championship fairways&nbsp;&nbsp;
and most importantly: temperate grass that&nbsp;
doesn't need a nuclear plant to stay alive.
MBS offered the world's largest&nbsp;
refrigerator. The PIF offered green.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On a mountain where God once spoke, that&nbsp;
choice matters more than you might think.&nbsp;
What we just witnessed on September 16th wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;
a snap decision. It was the final act&nbsp;
of Game of Thrones with spreadsheets.
To understand what really happened, you&nbsp;
need to remember that Riyadh is full of&nbsp;&nbsp;
royals who remember when MBS was just one&nbsp;
of a thousand princes. We'll call them the&nbsp;&nbsp;
'Old Guard.' Business leaders who knew King&nbsp;
Salman when he was the Governor of Riyadh.
For years, they backed MBS’ vision. Not because&nbsp;
they loved mirror cities, but because they agreed&nbsp;&nbsp;
with his diagnosis and his cure for what ails&nbsp;
Saudi Arabia - which I will tell you in a minute.
But when the bills came due—when 'expensive'&nbsp;
became 'existential'—they struck:&nbsp;&nbsp;
They poisoned their adversary's&nbsp;
power base... with audits.
&nbsp;
First, they got MBS to fire his own visionaries&nbsp;
by making them look incompetent. By Fall 2024,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the contrast became undeniable. Red&nbsp;
Sea Global opened early to acclaim,&nbsp;&nbsp;
while Sindalah limped across late, way over&nbsp;
budget — and riddled with quality problems.
&nbsp;
That performance gap was the final nail in&nbsp;
NEOM's coffin—triggering the management purge.
&nbsp;
Soon after, the PIF’s audit chief Mike&nbsp;
Cheung set up shop at Neom. Then came the&nbsp;&nbsp;
audits. The write-offs. The "strategic&nbsp;
reviews”, which technically followed&nbsp;&nbsp;
MBS's orders while systematically&nbsp;
destroying his dream within 9 months.
The September 16th 'decision' was just&nbsp;
MBS signing the death certificate for&nbsp;&nbsp;
something the PIF had already killed.
But here's what our "Westerner" brains&nbsp;&nbsp;
cannot process: Why would they sabotage&nbsp;
the Asian Games? Forget the money—this&nbsp;&nbsp;
is about wajh. Failing to host the&nbsp;
Games isn't just embarrassing MBS,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's humiliating Saudi Arabia in front of all&nbsp;
of Asia. The FIFA World Cup is even worse—&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why announce NEOM as a host city just to scrap it&nbsp;
one year later? Sure, they can move it to Al Ula,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but that's a catastrophic loss of&nbsp;
face they should avoid at all costs.
&nbsp;
Drop your theories below, especially if you’re&nbsp;
a “local” — because this is the part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
magic trick even we haven't figured out yet.
So is that the Prestige? Has this magic trick&nbsp;&nbsp;
failed like Siegfried and Roy’s last show,&nbsp;
with the PIF being the tiger? (Too soon?)
Nope. We’ve told you the what and the&nbsp;
how, but we haven’t told you the why.
&nbsp;
Because building the buildings was never&nbsp;
the point. They were the magician’s left&nbsp;&nbsp;
hand keeping you distracted, while his&nbsp;
right hand was performing the real trick.
"You have to bring it back. That's why every&nbsp;
magic trick has a third act. The hardest part.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The part we call the PRESTIGE."
While we were focused on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
impossible architecture, Saudi Arabia was&nbsp;
rebuilding itself from the inside out.
The buildings were never the&nbsp;
trick. The trick was using&nbsp;&nbsp;
the buildings to transform an entire civilization.
Here's what actually happened in 2022&nbsp;
at what we call the Thanos moment:
Avengers, assemble!
When Olivier Pron dropped&nbsp;&nbsp;
those impossible renders, something clicked&nbsp;
inside MBS. The Line was never meant to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
built—it was meant to be the perfect cover for&nbsp;
what no Saudi ruler had dreamed in 80 years:
A new holiday decided by royal decree last month&nbsp;
marks the day in 1727 when Muhammad bin Saud,&nbsp;&nbsp;
founder of the first Saudi state, rose to&nbsp;
prominence after taking over the Emirate of&nbsp;&nbsp;
Diriya. This is 17 years before what historians&nbsp;
consider as the beginning of the Saudi state,&nbsp;&nbsp;
when bin Saud forged an alliance with Muhammad&nbsp;
ibn Abdul Wahab. So now they're taking that date&nbsp;&nbsp;
even earlier and in effect removing Muhammad&nbsp;
ibn Abdul Wahab from the story. Wahhabism is&nbsp;&nbsp;
a purist doctrine of Islam and has governed&nbsp;
the fabric of Saudi society for decades"
Three centuries of extremist religious&nbsp;&nbsp;
doctrine—deleted. And MBS&nbsp;
was pretty blunt about why:
"Today, we cannot attract capital, we cannot&nbsp;
have tourism, we cannot make progress with the&nbsp;&nbsp;
presence of extremist ideology in the Kingdom&nbsp;
of Saudi Arabia. If you want millions of&nbsp;&nbsp;
jobs, for unemployment to go down, if&nbsp;
you want the economy to improve... you&nbsp;&nbsp;
must uproot this project [of extremism]."
His approval rating jumped to 80% AFTER he&nbsp;&nbsp;
erased Wahhabism. Not despite it. Because&nbsp;
of it. But the real prestige wasn't just&nbsp;&nbsp;
deleting an old ideology. It was what&nbsp;
grew in its place. Here’s Rory Jones:
&nbsp;
In 2023, for the first time, 50% of Saudi Arabia's&nbsp;
real GDP came from sources other than oil. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;
sort of like as MBS was trying to build NEOM,&nbsp;
this new place where anything was possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the rest of Saudi Arabia has actually become more&nbsp;
like NEOM, the place that he was dreaming of.&nbsp;
Absolutely. Yeah, definitely. I think MBS&nbsp;
has really initiated a bunch of changes in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the rest of the kingdom. The main, the raison&nbsp;
d'être for Neom, you know, isn't as strong.
So what will become of Neom? It's not&nbsp;
going away—MBS tied his reputation to it,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but here's what survival mode sounds like:
Do you have a budget? And the budget is clear?
We're working on it. The budget evolves every day.&nbsp;
"Budget evolves every day" means&nbsp;
'we're still fighting for money.' Heck,&nbsp;&nbsp;
NEOM didn't even make it into Saudi's 2026&nbsp;
budget after three years of top billing.
Remember the corpse floating in the pool, still&nbsp;
blinking at us? In Saudi culture, you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;
announce failure—you announce a new 'strategic&nbsp;
partnership' with Red Sea and 'elevate' Pagano&nbsp;&nbsp;
to NEOM's board. NEOM's got the brand, Red Sea's&nbsp;
got the builders, and Pagano's going to run it.
Start with Sindalah, and end with everything.&nbsp;
And we mean EVERYTHING! Pagano just freaking&nbsp;&nbsp;
announced expanding to Italy after MBS granted&nbsp;
him Saudi citizenship. Translation: Sindalah's&nbsp;&nbsp;
not a job—it's Pagano's entrance exam for a&nbsp;
tourism empire that won't stop at Saudi borders.
But there's one mystery we haven't solved:&nbsp;
Why there? Of all the places in Saudi Arabia&nbsp;&nbsp;
to stage this trillion-dollar magic trick,&nbsp;
why choose that specific patch of desert?
“The presently accepted location of the mountain&nbsp;
in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt has been debated&nbsp;&nbsp;
by many scholars. The early chapters of&nbsp;
Exodus tell us, in fact, that Mount Sinai&nbsp;&nbsp;
is in Midian, which is in Saudi Arabia.”
The NEOM region used to be called Midian.
It’s where a young exiled Egyptian prince - Moses,&nbsp;
Musa to locals - spent a decade in apprenticeship&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the prophet Shuʿayb, learning the ancient&nbsp;
ways of the force before his greater calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ancient Egyptians knew the nomads here as&nbsp;
the 'Shasu of Yahweh.' That's right, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;
the first time God's holiest name, יהוה appears&nbsp;
in recorded history together with a ZIP code. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Abrahamic God is technically a NEOM local.
“When we speak of a certain mountain, we usually&nbsp;&nbsp;
mean a certain peak. But people of the ancient&nbsp;
Middle East did not think of that. When the Bible&nbsp;&nbsp;
refers to Horeb as the mountain of God, think of&nbsp;
a mountain range rather than a specific peak.”
This is Jebel al-Lawz - also known as Mount Horeb.
“For the place where you now stand is holy ground”
For 35 centuries, this has been holy ground—where&nbsp;
Moses met the burning bush, Elijah heard God&nbsp;&nbsp;
whisper, and where a young Saudi Prince, far&nbsp;
from the throne, sought his own revelation.
&nbsp;
According to Rory Jones, young MBS hiked on Mt&nbsp;
Horeb, and then built his royal palace here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And now he’s upgrading God’s infrastructure.
&nbsp;
Leyja rises where believers place the twelve&nbsp;
springs of Elim. Trojena's entry point,&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Mirage sits a stone’s throw from the Split&nbsp;
Rock where Moses struck water. The Time-Travel&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tunnel replaces dusty pilgrimage paths,&nbsp;
whisking tourists to the Vault, then up to&nbsp;&nbsp;
the 340-meter Discovery Tower — apparently&nbsp;
even divine WiFi needs a range extender.
&nbsp;
And in between it all, something unexpected. NEOM&nbsp;
fenced off three massive strips of land to create&nbsp;&nbsp;
their Nature Reserve. Just by keeping out sheep&nbsp;
and camels, the desert started healing itself&nbsp;&nbsp;
- actual grass cover where there was only sand.&nbsp;
On top of natural recovery, they’ve planted 1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;
million native trees across 20 square kilometers,&nbsp;
terraforming barren desert into a dry savannah.
Once it started to flourish, they stocked&nbsp;
it with better looking wildlife. We saw the&nbsp;&nbsp;
proof firsthand: Ostriches - curious enough&nbsp;
to investigate our windows - sand gazelles,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nubian ibexes, Arabian oryxes, all thriving.
They even plan to reintroduce Asian&nbsp;
cheetahs and Arabian leopards,&nbsp;&nbsp;
as soon as the dinner - sorry, prey&nbsp;
- population grows large enough.
While the world debated mirror walls and robot&nbsp;
deliveries, the old guard inside the PIF helped&nbsp;&nbsp;
MBS delete three centuries of religious law. On&nbsp;
September 16th, they checked their work: Wahhabism&nbsp;&nbsp;
dead? Check. Society transformed? Check. Time to&nbsp;
stop paying for the world's most expensive prop.
The Line is dead. Long live The&nbsp;
Line. Because here's the thing&nbsp;&nbsp;
about expensive funerals - they're not&nbsp;
for the dead, they're for the living.&nbsp;&nbsp;
MBS spent $100 billion on a funeral for&nbsp;
Wahhabism. The Line was just the world's&nbsp;&nbsp;
most breathtaking coffin. And on September&nbsp;
16th, the PIF finally buried it. Both of them.
Mountains have been moved,
Deserts have been rewilded,&nbsp;
Lakes are being conjured,
While futures are being decided.
And here’s a crazy thought: What if God was tired&nbsp;
of desert beige? What if He just wanted a better&nbsp;&nbsp;
view? What if He was tired of people using&nbsp;
Him as a justification for social oppression?
&nbsp;
And what if, for the first time in a&nbsp;
very long while, someone was bold enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;
rich enough, maybe just crazy enough&nbsp;
… to try and change things for Him?
&nbsp;
If that’s blasphemy, hit the comments; if&nbsp;
it’s prophecy, hit subscribe. As always,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I’m Steve—this is Gigaprojects—and I’ll&nbsp;
see you on Mount Horeb. Where apparently,&nbsp;&nbsp;
God's got better WiFi than NEOM ever will.
