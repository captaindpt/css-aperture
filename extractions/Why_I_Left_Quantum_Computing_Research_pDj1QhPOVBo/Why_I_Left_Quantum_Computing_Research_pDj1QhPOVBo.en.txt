If someone was to make a fully functioning&nbsp;
quantum computer tomorrow, then at least at&nbsp;&nbsp;
the moment, we wouldn't have all that much we&nbsp;
could do with it. I left quantum Computing in&nbsp;&nbsp;
2020 after finishing an applied maths PhD in that&nbsp;
field from Cambridge University. And the thing is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'd loved being a researcher and I&nbsp;
even got offered a few postdocs kind&nbsp;&nbsp;
of informally when I was thinking about&nbsp;
leaving, but I still decided to leave.
And the reason is because I became a little&nbsp;
bit concerned that maybe quantum computers&nbsp;&nbsp;
aren't gonna be as useful in the real&nbsp;
world as we might have hoped. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's been five years and a lot has happened&nbsp;
in quantum computing. So I want to go back&nbsp;&nbsp;
and see if my assessment from back then is&nbsp;
really still looking like it's gonna be true.
So yeah, on the hardware front, I think things&nbsp;
are actually going really well. In 2020,&nbsp;&nbsp;
when I left, most quantum computing&nbsp;
companies only had like. Dozens of&nbsp;&nbsp;
qubits. I think the state of the&nbsp;
art might have been like around 50,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but now there are companies that have like 10&nbsp;
times that, and what's even more impressive&nbsp;&nbsp;
is that most companies seem to be on track with&nbsp;
what they said they would be able to do in 2025.
I mean, I'm not an expert in that area, but&nbsp;
it seems like despite all the incredible&nbsp;&nbsp;
challenges engineering wise, to make it&nbsp;
happen. These companies are doing it,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is awesome. I have no idea when fully&nbsp;
functioning quantum computers will be built,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but some people say 10 years or 20 years,&nbsp;
and I have no reason not to believe that.
I think that we really are on track, but on&nbsp;
the software front. I think things have been&nbsp;&nbsp;
much more disappointing. To explain why I need to&nbsp;
explain one of the most misunderstood things about&nbsp;&nbsp;
quantum computers. Quantum computers are not&nbsp;
just general purpose super computers. It's not&nbsp;&nbsp;
like every single thing that you do on a regular&nbsp;
computer can be done faster on a quantum computer.
Like you can't play games faster on a quantum&nbsp;
computer. In fact, quantum computers are very&nbsp;&nbsp;
specialized at doing very specific tasks, and&nbsp;
I wanna explain a little bit about quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;
computers so you can see why that is. I'm not&nbsp;
gonna explain what a qubit is or anything like&nbsp;&nbsp;
that because if you wanna see a full explanation&nbsp;
of like exactly how a quantum computer works, then&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have a video that you can watch where I built&nbsp;
a small kind of useless quantum computer at home.
And hopefully that explains it a little bit&nbsp;
better. But right now what I wanna do is give&nbsp;&nbsp;
you an overview of like how you should be thinking&nbsp;
about what a quantum computer can do and what it&nbsp;&nbsp;
can't do. Let's say that this is a normal computer&nbsp;
that does this algorithm. Every time you put in a&nbsp;&nbsp;
bit string, if I put that into my computer, I type&nbsp;
it in, then it will output some other bit string.
There's some sort of computation that this&nbsp;
program is doing to the bit string to make&nbsp;&nbsp;
it something else. Well, what happens when&nbsp;
you replace this computation with the quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;
version of this computation? So let's say&nbsp;
this is my amazing quantum computer. It acts&nbsp;&nbsp;
in a very similar way where if you put in this&nbsp;
bit string, you'll get out another bit string.
But the thing that you can do with&nbsp;
quantum computers that you can't,&nbsp;&nbsp;
with a classical computer is you can put&nbsp;
in more than one input at a time. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can put in every possible bit string&nbsp;
and the output, instead of being a single&nbsp;&nbsp;
number will a combination of. All of the&nbsp;
outputs for every single one of the inputs.
This seems miraculous, right? Like you can&nbsp;
do an exponential amount of computation&nbsp;&nbsp;
with the same amount of resources that a regular&nbsp;
computer would take to just do one computation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This seems like there needs to be some sort of&nbsp;
catch, and there is, you see, it is true that&nbsp;&nbsp;
a quantum computer truly does do this whole&nbsp;
amount of computation all at the same time.
The problem is when you try and ask the&nbsp;
quantum computer what the answer is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
so with a regular computer, you might expect&nbsp;
it just outputs this whole thing in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's readable. But with a quantum computer,&nbsp;
you have to then go and measure this output.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And when you measure it, what happens is it&nbsp;
collapses to just one of these things randomly.
So all the rest is completely gone, and you&nbsp;
just have one number that comes out and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
just a random computation, and that is not&nbsp;
useful. You see, even though technically a&nbsp;&nbsp;
quantum computer really does do a huge amount of&nbsp;
parallel computation at once with the same cost&nbsp;&nbsp;
that a regular computer would take to just&nbsp;
do one computation, it's not possible to.
Easily extract all that information. In fact,&nbsp;
you can extract very little from the output,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and if you do it in the naive way of&nbsp;
just trying to look at the answer,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you just get a random answer. So, how are quantum&nbsp;
computers ever going to be useful then? It turns&nbsp;&nbsp;
out for very particular types of computations&nbsp;
that it is possible to extract just slightly&nbsp;&nbsp;
more information from this whole huge list that&nbsp;
lets you actually get out something very useful.
This is my second sponsorship for&nbsp;
the charity farm kind and they told&nbsp;&nbsp;
me that last time loads of you donated,&nbsp;
which is so awesome. Thank you so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So almost no one thinks it's okay for chickens&nbsp;
to live in horribly crammed cages like this for&nbsp;&nbsp;
their entire lives, where they can barely&nbsp;
even move. But it's still really common.
This report from June of 2025 by the USDA says&nbsp;
that about 55% of all egg laying hens are in cages&nbsp;&nbsp;
like these. The mission of Farm Kind is to prevent&nbsp;
these kind of cruelties in the most effective&nbsp;&nbsp;
way possible. They research which charities&nbsp;
have actually made the biggest difference for&nbsp;&nbsp;
animals. And then when you donate to Farm Kind,&nbsp;
they split that money amongst these charities.
So for example, the Humane League, they&nbsp;
run campaigns that have pressured the&nbsp;&nbsp;
likes of McDonald's, Walmart, and Nestle&nbsp;
to treating their hands better. The track&nbsp;&nbsp;
record is so good that they can prevent&nbsp;
a chicken from living her entire life in&nbsp;&nbsp;
one of these terrible cages for just 85 cents.&nbsp;
It often feels like we can't change the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but for the individual animals&nbsp;
that your donations will help.
It makes all of the difference. So if you wanna&nbsp;
donate, the link is in the description and I&nbsp;&nbsp;
would really appreciate it. Now, back to the&nbsp;
video. Let me give you the classic example,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shor's factoring algorithm. So the&nbsp;
problem that Shor's algorithm is&nbsp;&nbsp;
trying to solve is called factoring.&nbsp;
So say I give you this massive number.
Then the factoring problem asks, what are&nbsp;
the two numbers that you have to multiply&nbsp;&nbsp;
to get that massive number? In other words,&nbsp;
can you factorized this number? And it turns&nbsp;&nbsp;
out this is really hard to do on a classical&nbsp;
computer. Like, yes, you can do it by sort&nbsp;&nbsp;
of just checking every single factor,&nbsp;
but that will take you ages and ages.
But in 1999, Peter Shor showed that&nbsp;
actually you can solve this problem&nbsp;&nbsp;
quite quickly on a quantum computer.&nbsp;
The first step of that algorithm does&nbsp;&nbsp;
look like putting in a huge super position&nbsp;
of all the inputs into a quantum computer&nbsp;&nbsp;
and calculating the output. But the next&nbsp;
step is not to just go and measure this,&nbsp;&nbsp;
because as we already saw, doing that just&nbsp;
collapses the state and is totally useless.
So instead, Shor's algorithm uses&nbsp;
a very clever way of manipulating&nbsp;&nbsp;
this state further. So you put this back into.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another quantum computer doing a whole lot more&nbsp;
steps and you end up with. Some sort of quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;
state here, where now it is possible to measure&nbsp;
this state and actually get out a little bit of&nbsp;&nbsp;
useful information, and that is just enough to&nbsp;
find out how to factorized that huge number.
But the point is you have to come up with some&nbsp;
very clever manipulation at this part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
quantum computer, a particular algorithm&nbsp;
that is going to take out just the useful&nbsp;&nbsp;
bit of information so that at the end you&nbsp;
can read out what that information is.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Designing this algorithm is hard and it depends&nbsp;
exactly what the problem you wanna solve is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and some problems like factoring&nbsp;
have turned out to be amenable.
So it turns out there are a bunch of problems&nbsp;
like that where we have been able to come up&nbsp;&nbsp;
with some very clever quantum algorithm&nbsp;
that does let us extract the information&nbsp;&nbsp;
we want and solve the problem. But&nbsp;
for most hard problems that you might&nbsp;&nbsp;
wanna solve with a quantum computer. We&nbsp;
haven't yet found quantum algorithms.
That might be because no one has yet&nbsp;
found it, or it could be that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;
no algorithm to find that quantum computers&nbsp;
just can't solve that class of problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and we never know which it is until&nbsp;
someone eventually finds a quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;
algorithm for that problem. So you can see&nbsp;
why quantum algorithm design is quite tricky.
You really never know which problems&nbsp;
you're going to be able to solve with&nbsp;&nbsp;
a quantum computer or not. When&nbsp;
Shaw's algorithm came out in 1994,&nbsp;&nbsp;
there was a lot of enthusiasm that we would be&nbsp;
able to find many more problems like factoring&nbsp;&nbsp;
that quantum computers would be able to do&nbsp;
so much better than classical computers.
And yet, by the time I was leaving my PhD in&nbsp;
2020, I was pretty disappointed by the lack of&nbsp;&nbsp;
progress. There were of course, other quantum&nbsp;
algorithms like for example, phase estimation,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is actually very related to Shor's factoring&nbsp;
algorithm, and also another one called Hamiltonian&nbsp;&nbsp;
simulation, which is quite different and&nbsp;
allows you to simulate quantum objects.
I. Now, five years later, I wanna go back&nbsp;
and see if, well, there's any new algorithms,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but also whether there have been new&nbsp;
applications found for the existing&nbsp;&nbsp;
algorithms. And the spoiler is, I think&nbsp;
it's been a little bit disappointing,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but there have been some hopeful signs.&nbsp;
Let's start with quantum machine learning.
So we've all seen how incredibly good AI&nbsp;
systems are, and I think there's this worry&nbsp;&nbsp;
that sometimes gets brought up in the media&nbsp;
that when we have full quantum computers,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we're going to have these supercharged ais. In&nbsp;
fact, when I was in the field, quantum machine&nbsp;&nbsp;
learning was super popular and there seemed to be&nbsp;
papers being churned out about it all the time.
But I was very, very skeptical that&nbsp;
any of those would amount to much,&nbsp;&nbsp;
because I just don't think that quantum computers&nbsp;
are very well suited to machine learning problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Quantum computers often exploit structure&nbsp;
and you know, machine learning algorithms&nbsp;&nbsp;
are all about putting in. Tons of data and&nbsp;
the data isn't particularly structured.
It's like whatever examples, for example, from&nbsp;
the internet. So I just don't think this is&nbsp;&nbsp;
playing to quantum computer's strength,&nbsp;
and it seems like more and more people&nbsp;&nbsp;
have gone off this quantum machine learning&nbsp;
idea. So I don't think that's gonna be a big&nbsp;&nbsp;
deal. But there is another area that gets&nbsp;
heaps of hype that may be more justified.
In fact, when I was in quantum computing,&nbsp;
this was the area of quantum computing I was&nbsp;&nbsp;
most excited for, and which I was ultimately&nbsp;
most disappointed by. It's quantum chemistry.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Simulating molecules is a big deal, for&nbsp;
example, in medicine where you wanna see&nbsp;&nbsp;
how a particular drug is going to interact&nbsp;
with, for example, proteins in your body.
And so there was a lot of promise about&nbsp;
quantum computers being able to speed up&nbsp;&nbsp;
these very important, um, chemical simulations.&nbsp;
At the time, that seemed justified to me because&nbsp;&nbsp;
quantum computers are able to do something&nbsp;
called ground state energy estimation,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and they seem to do it exponentially&nbsp;
more quickly than a classical computer.
But it turned out, there's actually an&nbsp;
assumption in there that kind of makes&nbsp;&nbsp;
the whole thing invalid. So let me explain. Say&nbsp;
you had these two chemicals and you wanna know&nbsp;&nbsp;
what's the chance that they're going to bond&nbsp;
together and how hard is it gonna be to make&nbsp;&nbsp;
them do that? One way to get a handle on that is&nbsp;
to estimate the energy of both of these states.
So you can look at this state and you can look&nbsp;
at its energy and you can look at this whole&nbsp;&nbsp;
state and look at its energy. And if this energy&nbsp;
is significantly lower than that one, then it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
more likely to end up in this state. Estimating&nbsp;
these ground state energies is super important,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and there's a quantum algorithm called phase&nbsp;
estimation that seems to do it super well.
This is the gist of it. You put in a blank qubit&nbsp;
that you're going to write the answer onto, and&nbsp;&nbsp;
you also put in this qubit, which is in the ground&nbsp;
state. If you have this ground state and the blank&nbsp;&nbsp;
qubit, you can just put them straight into your&nbsp;
quantum computer That does phase estimation,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and then the blank qubit ends up coming out&nbsp;
of this computation with the ground state&nbsp;&nbsp;
energy just ridden straight onto it, and you can&nbsp;
read that out and find out what the energy was.
So this seems perfect because this algorithm&nbsp;
runs really fast, and so it seems like you&nbsp;&nbsp;
can find out the ground state energy of&nbsp;
any molecules, which would be huge. But&nbsp;&nbsp;
unfortunately the trick is this thing. So this&nbsp;
is a state, a qubit state, which represents&nbsp;&nbsp;
the ground state of the molecules. In&nbsp;
other words, you need to already know.
What the ground state of those molecules&nbsp;
is to be able to run this algorithm. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
can kind of see the problem, right? But&nbsp;
at the time I thought that this would be&nbsp;&nbsp;
fine because there are ways to estimate&nbsp;
what the ground state would look like&nbsp;&nbsp;
more or less. And as long as there's a good&nbsp;
overlap between your guess and the reality,&nbsp;&nbsp;
then you end up with something that&nbsp;
is good enough to find the energy.
But there's no guarantee that your guests&nbsp;
and the actual ground state will have all&nbsp;&nbsp;
that much overlap. It was actually a couple of&nbsp;
friends of mine who weren't in quantum computing,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but did know a whole lot about chemistry&nbsp;
and biology that actually pointed this out&nbsp;&nbsp;
to me. They made me see that there's actually&nbsp;
no guarantee that this overlap is big, and so&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's not clear at all that quantum computers&nbsp;
can solve this ground state energy problem.
And in fact, in 2022 there was a paper&nbsp;
called. Is there evidence for exponential&nbsp;&nbsp;
quantum advantage? And it was written by a whole&nbsp;
lot of very respected scientists in the quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;
computing field and also in chemistry. And so&nbsp;
their conclusion was this. We conclude that&nbsp;&nbsp;
evidence for such an exponential advantage&nbsp;
across chemical space has yet to be found.
While quantum computers may still prove&nbsp;
useful for quantum chemistry. It may be&nbsp;&nbsp;
prudent to assume exponential speedups are&nbsp;
not generically available for this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So yeah, quantum computers aren't&nbsp;
actually a silver bullet for solving&nbsp;&nbsp;
quantum chemistry problems, but there is&nbsp;
a class of problems that's quite related&nbsp;&nbsp;
that quantum computers are surprisingly&nbsp;
good at, and that's quantum simulations.
Quantum simulations are actually what&nbsp;
inspired quantum computing. The idea is&nbsp;&nbsp;
simple. Quantum systems are actually very&nbsp;
hard to simulate in general if you try to,&nbsp;&nbsp;
for example, simulate what a bunch of&nbsp;
electrons are doing when they interact&nbsp;&nbsp;
with each other. Quantum mechanically,&nbsp;
you find that on a regular computer.
This is really, really hard to do. The&nbsp;
number of possible states inside of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
super position become exponential, and so&nbsp;
it's hard even on a classical computer to&nbsp;&nbsp;
write down all of these states. And so&nbsp;
quantum simulation has always been a&nbsp;&nbsp;
difficult problem. But for a quantum&nbsp;
computer, it's actually quite easy.
So what quantum computers can do is they&nbsp;
can simulate the way that electrons evolve&nbsp;&nbsp;
by having their qubits sort of interact with each&nbsp;
other in a similar way. And by doing that analog,&nbsp;&nbsp;
they can give us a pretty good picture of&nbsp;
what the original electrons would've done,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and this turns out to be very useful.
So here are some examples of what we might do&nbsp;
with quantum simulations. So you might have&nbsp;&nbsp;
heard of these things called superconductors.&nbsp;
Superconductors are these kind of magical&nbsp;&nbsp;
materials that have no electrical resistance.&nbsp;
That means that when you use them in a circuit,&nbsp;&nbsp;
they don't lose energy. But the problem&nbsp;
with superconductors is that the ones&nbsp;&nbsp;
that we know of have to be cooled&nbsp;
down quite a lot to actually work.
So one thing people dream of is coming up&nbsp;
with high temperature superconductors. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
we just have to figure out the exact materials&nbsp;
to use to make the superconductor so that it has&nbsp;&nbsp;
zero resistance even at room temperature.&nbsp;
So. And quantum computers might help with&nbsp;&nbsp;
that because it's really hard to simulate these&nbsp;
kind of materials before you actually make them.
Because of those problems I was talking&nbsp;
about earlier. It's hard to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;
what the electrons are all doing,&nbsp;
and so the easiest way to do it at&nbsp;&nbsp;
the moment is just to make all of these&nbsp;
materials and then test them in the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But that's really difficult when there's so many&nbsp;
different materials that you can make and test.
So the idea is that, you know, once we&nbsp;
eventually have a quantum computer. We&nbsp;&nbsp;
would be able to basically just computer&nbsp;
simulate what all of these different&nbsp;&nbsp;
materials are gonna do and then just&nbsp;
pick out the most promising candidates&nbsp;&nbsp;
to use in the lab. And I think that&nbsp;
that's a very exciting application.
There are similar problems like this, like&nbsp;
for example, solar cells. You might know&nbsp;&nbsp;
that at the moment our solar cells are like&nbsp;
somewhere around, I think 20 to 25% efficient,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is pretty good. Like they can take 25% of&nbsp;
the energy that falls on them and convert that&nbsp;&nbsp;
into electricity. But that is actually near&nbsp;
the limit of what's possible with silicon.
The hope is that we'll be able to find&nbsp;
different types of solar cells that have better&nbsp;&nbsp;
efficiencies, and people have already started&nbsp;
working on these and have examples of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but hopefully once we have quantum computers,&nbsp;
we'll be able to simulate way more materials&nbsp;&nbsp;
and find something with really high efficiency&nbsp;
because computing the efficiency that a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;
material is going to have before you actually&nbsp;
make it in the lab and test it is again very hard.
There's many other examples like that, like for&nbsp;
example, nitrogen fixation. We wanna figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;
how we can do that much more efficiently than the&nbsp;
current harbor brush process. And there's also&nbsp;&nbsp;
applications inside of science. So for example,&nbsp;
you might have heard that quantum computers can be&nbsp;&nbsp;
used to simulate some models of black holes, and&nbsp;
that may be somewhat useful for, you know, people&nbsp;&nbsp;
who are studying this to understand what kind of&nbsp;
behavior those sort of black holes would have.
So yeah, I think that there are actually&nbsp;
a lot of applications in this area that&nbsp;&nbsp;
are very promising. So that is great. This&nbsp;
isn't a new algorithm. Hamiltonian simulation&nbsp;&nbsp;
is a fairly old algorithm. Where are the&nbsp;
new algorithms? Well, amazingly and very&nbsp;&nbsp;
unexpectedly in the last five years, there&nbsp;
has been at least one new algorithm, so.
In 2023, a group of researchers proved&nbsp;
that a particular problem with a random&nbsp;&nbsp;
oracle could be solved on a quantum&nbsp;
computer exponentially faster than&nbsp;&nbsp;
could be solved on a classical one. That&nbsp;
is really cool as a theoretical result.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But this random Oracle bit means that it&nbsp;
can't actually be made in practice still.
I am actually really hopeful&nbsp;
about that because usually when&nbsp;&nbsp;
there are algorithms of this sort where&nbsp;
they're sort of relative to some oracle,&nbsp;&nbsp;
often people come up with a way to take that&nbsp;
idea and put it into a practical algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like I think Shaw's algorithm even came out&nbsp;
of sort of Oracle like results like that.
So that's proof that there really are&nbsp;
other quantum algorithms out there,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and I think it's really exciting.&nbsp;
If you work in quantum computing,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you might have worried that like most of my&nbsp;
videos sounded quite negative and I'm really&nbsp;&nbsp;
sorry about that. I actually don't wanna&nbsp;
come down too hard on quantum computing.
I just think that there has been a bit of&nbsp;
a misallocation where a lot of work has,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of course, gone into the hardware because&nbsp;
it's a very hard problem and a lot of work&nbsp;&nbsp;
has gone into, for example, quantum error&nbsp;
correction, but it just seems like quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;
algorithms have been neglected. If a&nbsp;
quantum computer appeared tomorrow,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we need things that we're going&nbsp;
to use that quantum computer for.
So we need to be searching&nbsp;
for good quantum algorithms,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but at least when I was in the field. It wasn't&nbsp;
very popular to work on quantum algorithms,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and that's because it had a reputation&nbsp;
for being really hard, which makes sense&nbsp;&nbsp;
because so few algorithms have been found,&nbsp;
and even when new algorithms are found,&nbsp;&nbsp;
often there's a mistake with them or people show&nbsp;
that actually classical computers can do that too.
And so it's quite a hard field to be working in,&nbsp;
but I think it's one of the most important. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
yeah, I'm hopeful about quantum computers, but I&nbsp;
think that there is a lot of work left to be done.
