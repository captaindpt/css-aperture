00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.600
If you want to know if someone really understands&nbsp;
evolution, just ask them this one weird question.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.360
Why does poop smell bad?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.240
Oh.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.040
Oh, gosh.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.800
Because it has bacteria in it, I guess?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.880
Microbiome, probably.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.680
Trash-

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.473
Yeah, trash from the gut.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:15.120
... of the body.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.400
The food we eat?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Because of the chemicals?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.640
Farts don't always smell bad.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.200
Yeah. Well, that's a different question&nbsp;
entirely. Do you think it objectively smells bad?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.560
Yes, I think so.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.960
Yes.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.280
How do you think it smells to flies?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.555
Like the fly?

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:31.360
Yeah-
They like it.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.670
They love it.
They like it, yeah.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.480
They love it.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.160
Animals love stinky things.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.600
Yeah.
They're attracted to it.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.120
Poop smells good to flies because&nbsp;
poop is full of nutrients.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.040
They use it as food.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
But it's also full of bacteria that&nbsp;
can be life-threatening to humans.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.720
So the real reason poop&nbsp;
smells bad to us is because

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.520
if anyone ever thought it smelled good,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.680
they would probably get really sick,&nbsp;
die, and not pass on their genes.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.640
After all, it's about survival of the fittest.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.120
But survival of the fittest what?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.880
I mean, most people think of natural selection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.000
as being about the survival of&nbsp;
the fittest individual animal.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.640
Individual.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.280
Individuals.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.880
Individual animal.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.800
Animal. Okay, so it's like an individual.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.120
Yeah.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.080
Which makes sense.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.320
I mean, individuals best adapted to their&nbsp;
environment have increased odds of survival,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.880
and therefore a higher likelihood&nbsp;
of passing on their genes.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.560
So it follows that each individual should do&nbsp;
everything it can to survive and reproduce.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.720
That is, it should be selfish.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.240
But if that's true, then how do you explain this?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.880
Worker bees will sting&nbsp;
predators to protect the hive,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.520
even though it might kill them in the process.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.080
Female worker ants are sterile,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.000
so they can't reproduce,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.800
but regardless, they work for the colony&nbsp;
for their entire lives until they die.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.240
Monkeys adopt orphans, wolves bring&nbsp;
meat to non-hunting members of the pack,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.160
and squirrels can let out alarm calls&nbsp;
to warn others about nearby predators.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.600
So if natural selection is&nbsp;
all about selfish individuals,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.200
why do we observe so much altruism in nature?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.240
The survival is of the species that can adapt.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.440
I think generally the species.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.880
For the survival of the species.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.375
So it's the survival of the species.

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:12.960
Okay. Yeah, you're right.
Okay.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.600
But survival of the fittest species or&nbsp;
the fittest group also doesn't work.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.760
I mean, think about what you need&nbsp;
for natural selection to occur.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.800
You need something that replicates&nbsp;
itself many times over, creating copies,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.480
and then you need a pruning process,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.520
whereby some of those copies get eliminated and&nbsp;
some thrive to go on and create more copies.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.280
The problem with groups or species is that&nbsp;
they don’t typically make copies of themselves.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.160
So you almost never get copies of groups fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.280
other copies of groups to&nbsp;
see which groups win out.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.560
So if it's not survival of the fittest individual&nbsp;
and it's not survival of the fittest group,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.920
then what is it?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.280
Well, to explain that, I want&nbsp;
to take you on a little journey,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:06.560
all the way back to the beginnings of the Earth.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.600
Where we are now, there is nothing.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.240
Well, not really nothing, but nothing interesting.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.120
There are only simple things, like these blobs.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.200
This one might be a carbon dioxide&nbsp;
molecule, or it might be cyanide.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.880
We don't know for sure what they are,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.760
but we do know that these&nbsp;
compounds are very simple.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.440
So for now, they'll just be&nbsp;
blobs floating around our void.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.280
In fact, much of what we'll encounter&nbsp;
along our journey here are just hypotheses.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.680
A lot of Earth's early history is still a mystery,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.520
so keep that in mind.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.640
Now, every so often, our&nbsp;
blobs get a surplus of energy,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.320
maybe from a ray of UV light&nbsp;
or a nearby hot source.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.240
This is the first major upgrade&nbsp;
to our void, excess energy,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.040
as it allows our blobs to&nbsp;
interact with each other.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.560
And most of the time, this&nbsp;
interaction leads to nothing,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.520
but sometimes these blobs can combine&nbsp;
into more complicated compounds.&nbsp;

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.760
Here's a simple simulated example,&nbsp;
where we only have four red blobs.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.000
Right now, they are all individual particles,&nbsp;
but each time step we move forward,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
let's say there's a 10% chance that all&nbsp;
four combine into one red mega-blob.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.560
And now imagine this mega-blob isn't very stable.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.400
For every time step it's alive,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.360
it has a 95% chance of falling apart&nbsp;
back into the four smaller blobs.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.560
If we add more of these red blobs into the mix,&nbsp;
you'll notice that they rarely ever come together.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.200
On average, a mega-blob only&nbsp;
exists around 10% of the time.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.920
But if we were to reduce the chances of&nbsp;
the mega-blobs dissolving to only 1%,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.520
the void would suddenly be filled with them.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.720
This fact hints at an important&nbsp;
law that governs our void,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.040
the law of stability.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.000
Unstable blobs fall apart and&nbsp;
vanish. Stable ones endure.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.880
Now, watch what happens if we&nbsp;
speed this up dramatically,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.400
maybe a couple of years per second,&nbsp;
maybe even a couple million.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.920
You can see our blobs keep&nbsp;
getting random jolts of energy,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.480
so they combine with others to&nbsp;
form more complex compounds.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.920
Most attempts fail and fall&nbsp;
apart, but every so often,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.280
by pure chance,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.760
you get a compound that is more&nbsp;
stable than the blobs it's made of.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.080
This doesn't happen because the blobs&nbsp;
want to build more complex structures.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.800
It's just because these new configurations&nbsp;
happen to be more favorable in the environment.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.240
And now when these complicated&nbsp;
compounds become abundant enough,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.640
they too get a chance to combine,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.480
making our void increasingly complex.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.320
And one day, by accident,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.760
this causes an extremely unique shape to form,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000
one with a special property.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
See, the blobs it's made of just happen to attract&nbsp;
similar blobs from the surrounding environment.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.240
This red blob always attracts green blobs,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.040
and this purple blob always attracts yellow ones,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.400
and piece by piece, all these&nbsp;
blobs attract their opposites

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.200
until their counterparts suddenly snap&nbsp;
into position next to the original shape.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.920
Now, this shape goes on to do the same thing.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.920
Its green blobs attract red ones

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.360
and yellow ones attract the purple until&nbsp;
another shape yet again snaps into position.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.560
This new shape looks exactly like the original.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.040
What just happened fully&nbsp;
spontaneously is replication.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.960
One shape became two.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.960
This marks the birth of the first replicator.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.600
We don't know exactly what&nbsp;
this replicator looked like.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.000
It might've been a single standalone molecule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.520
or a group of molecules that&nbsp;
worked together to replicate.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.200
There's a lot of debate on this today,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.880
so instead, let's represent&nbsp;
the replicator as a character.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.880
How about this one here?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.760
Perfect.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.120
Keep in mind it's still just a lifeless&nbsp;
molecule, one without any intent or purpose.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.960
Now, you might think that the chances for the&nbsp;
replicator to form were extremely unlikely,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.720
but in our void, where we have hundreds&nbsp;
of millions of years to play with,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.800
what might seem impossible to&nbsp;
us becomes virtually inevitable.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.720
And the thing is, the replicator&nbsp;
only has to arise once.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.600
Once it's here,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.520
it can take the simpler compounds available in the&nbsp;
environment to copy itself at a much faster pace.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.040
And so it does that,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.080
until it entirely fills our void.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.480
At least, that's what you'd expect,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.520
but there is a flaw in the process.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.160
See, during the replicator's conquest of the void,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.760
one of its copies makes a mistake.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.360
Perhaps a stray ray of UV light hits&nbsp;
it during the replication process,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.360
or the replicator uses a building&nbsp;
block it wasn't supposed to.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.000
As a result, what we're left with is a new shape,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.320
which is slightly different from its parent,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.600
and so its properties might&nbsp;
be slightly different too.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.000
This error might be harmful.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.480
For example, it might make the copy less stable.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.000
It could be beneficial, making&nbsp;
the copy better at replicating,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.600
or it could be neutral,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.640
not changing the replicator in any meaningful way.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.440
This marks the final milestone in our void,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.480
mutation.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.760
Many species of replicators now occupy the void,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.040
and what they do is they replicate themselves.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.560
The problem is they all need&nbsp;
the same limited resources,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.840
and so our void turns into a battleground.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.560
So which replicator will win? What&nbsp;
kind of properties will the void favor?

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.400
Well, let's try to simulate what happens.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.960
Now, if you’re looking to&nbsp;
run your own simulations,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.960
or need a place to run your own code

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.600
look no further than today’s sponsor — Hostinger.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.960
Say you wanted to keep track&nbsp;
of everyday science news.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.280
Manually filtering through thousands of articles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.520
for the most important stories&nbsp;
would be almost impossible!

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.160
But Hostinger lets you easily automate this.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.120
You can use n8n, a platform&nbsp;
that lets you automate tasks,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.040
but you need a place to host it.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.520
And the easiest, most price-effective and&nbsp;
secure place to host n8n workflows is on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.800
a Virtual Private Server or VPS from Hostinger!

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.920
It’s like a powerful computer&nbsp;
you rent on the cloud.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.400
So here’s how you can create an article scrubber:

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.640
The workflow can grab every new&nbsp;
science article from a list of portals.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.880
Then, it can send the articles to&nbsp;
Chat GPT to summarize their content.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.080
And finally, you can add these quick&nbsp;
summaries to a board in Notion.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.800
Using Hostinger’s pre-installed n8n template,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.040
the setup only takes one click, and&nbsp;
you’re good to start creating workflows.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.760
By hosting n8n on a Hostinger VPS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.320
you get all the resources needed to&nbsp;
run your workflow smoothly, 24/7!

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.600

Thanks to Hostinger for sponsoring this part&nbsp;
of the video, and now back to our simulation.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.800
To simulate what a replicator&nbsp;
battle might look like,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.040
let's assign simplified traits to each of&nbsp;
the replicators, starting with the first one.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.200
This replicator is special,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200
since it's the only one that can form&nbsp;
spontaneously from smaller building blocks.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.200
So we'll give it a spawn rate.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.640
This should be quite rare,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.200
so let's set the chance of&nbsp;
formation to 1% per time step.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.920
Just keep in mind we're just making these numbers&nbsp;
up. The simulation is purely illustrative.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.760
Now, once the replicator spawns,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.240
let's say it's governed by three key traits.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.440
First, a death rate,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.120
the chance of it falling apart or&nbsp;
being destroyed with each time step.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.840
Let's set that to be, say, 2%.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.520
Second, a replication rate,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.000
the chance to copy itself with each time step.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.520
Let's say 4%.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.520
And finally, a mutation rate,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.520
the chance a copy comes out mutated.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.400
If it's 4%, roughly one in&nbsp;
25 copies will be a mutation.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.880
So every time a new mutation spawns,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.120
it will inherit the replication death&nbsp;
and mutation stats from its parent,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.960
but slightly randomized.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.400
Notice that we won't give any of these&nbsp;
secondary replicators a spawn rate.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.920
They'll only be able to form as&nbsp;
mutations from previous generations.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.160
So if all of their copies die&nbsp;
out, they'll be gone for good.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.520
Now, before we run the simulation,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.840
I want to quickly shout out&nbsp;
the YouTube channel Primer.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.320
Our setup was inspired by his amazing&nbsp;
in-depth simulations on evolutionary biology.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.080
You should really check him out.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.160
Okay, let's run it.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.560
The graph on the right will&nbsp;
show how the populations grow,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.120
and this box on the left will&nbsp;
show a slice of the void,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.320
with all the winning replicators&nbsp;
and the correct ratios.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.440
You can see how the first replicator&nbsp;
appears and then immediately disappears,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.360
because it just happened to die&nbsp;
before it got the chance to replicate.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.160
But that's okay.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.760
The original replicator can be created from&nbsp;
smaller blobs, so it'll come back at some point.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.400
This time, it's starting to take off.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.960
You can also see that it spawns some&nbsp;
mutations, but they're struggling to keep up.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.080
Eventually, though, superior mutations pop up&nbsp;
and start to replicate faster than the original.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.800
But you can see almost all of them are&nbsp;
growing exponentially, which is unrealistic.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.760
That's because we're missing the&nbsp;
final piece of our simulation,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.200
limited resources.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.840
The building blocks should eventually run out.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.160
We can simulate this effect by introducing a sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.760
of resource factor to each&nbsp;
species' replication rate.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.400
This factor should depend on the total&nbsp;
number of replicators in the void, N,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.560
which will also divide with an&nbsp;
arbitrary crowding factor, C.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.200
C lets us define the maximum number of&nbsp;
replicators we'll allow into the void.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.960
Say C is 10,000.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.200
Then once there are 10,000 replicators,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.200
the two terms cancel out and drive&nbsp;
the replication rate down to zero,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.760
meaning none of the replicators will be able to&nbsp;
make copies until the population drops again.&nbsp;

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.120
So let's see how this changes our simulation.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.600
Okay.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.960
Like the last time, the original&nbsp;
replicator starts to grow,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.760
after which it's quickly&nbsp;
taken over by its mutations,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.560
but this time, most of these mutation&nbsp;
populations start to decline.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.840
Because of the scarce resources,&nbsp;
the new best population,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.200
the lime one,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.320
actually starts stealing&nbsp;
resources from the others.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.800
After that, a few more mutations pop&nbsp;
up, even more powerful than the lime.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.440
Ultimately, the purple replicator takes over,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.200
occupying around 9,000 of&nbsp;
the 10,000 available spaces.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.880
It completely curbs all the other populations.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.280
It goes without saying that the environment&nbsp;
plays a massive role in which replicator wins.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.720
If you change the environment,&nbsp;
you likely change the outcome.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.200
But let's look at the stats of the&nbsp;
replicator that came out on top this time.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.800
That winning species has&nbsp;
a replication rate of 20%,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.320
compared to the 17% average&nbsp;
across all populations.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.360
Obviously, being able to&nbsp;
replicate quickly pays off here.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.360
Its death rate is below average.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.720
Replicators that fall apart less&nbsp;
quickly can make more copies.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.720
And finally, it has a 1% mutation&nbsp;
rate, compared to the average of 3.73%.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.680
Although mutations help by injecting diversity,

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.200
for any single species,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.080
fewer mutations mean more faithful copies.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.160
If we rerun the simulation, you'll notice&nbsp;
the outcomes are always slightly different,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.320
but the winning species consistently have high&nbsp;
replication and low death and mutation rates.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.800
Now, in the real void, things&nbsp;
wouldn't have been as simple.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.640
Instead of just tweaking these three stats,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.280
the replicators would have to mutate all&nbsp;
sorts of different ways to gain an advantage.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.920
For example, one replicator might mutate a&nbsp;
trait that lets it destroy other individuals

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.440
and then use their building blocks&nbsp;
to make more copies of itself.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.440
This looks like strategy,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.880
but it's really just chemistry&nbsp;
that gets copied over and over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.360
because it helps the replicator survive.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.720
Naturally, a risk of offense would&nbsp;
likely favor mutations that result in defense.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.600
So an opposing replicator might&nbsp;
stumble upon a mutation that helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.320
it form protective barriers from nearby materials,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.960
letting it endure those attacks.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.880
These barriers would also help protect the&nbsp;
fragile replicators from environmental damage,

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.640
like UV light.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.560
This marks an important threshold.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.960
The replicator's traits aren't limited to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.680
determining the properties&nbsp;
of the molecules themselves.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.080
They can also shape the environment.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.040
So by chance,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.040
the replicators inevitably mutate in&nbsp;
ways that build scaffolding around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.400
themselves to increase the&nbsp;
chances of their survival.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.320
They stumble upon ways of making&nbsp;
structures to propel themselves around.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.360
They develop senses and ways of storing energy.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.280
They even mix, exchange, and&nbsp;
steal traits from each other.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.960
Through billions of years of trial and error,&nbsp;
this scaffolding gets more and more complex,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.840
and as a result,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:35.120
the replicator's interactions with&nbsp;
the void become exceedingly indirect.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.240
They build complex survival&nbsp;
machines for themselves,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.880
machines whose sole purpose is to&nbsp;
protect the replicators inside.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.000
These machines became such experts at surviving,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.440
they're still around some 4 billion years later.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.200
They are the bacteria,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.840
plants,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.400
fungi,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.640
and animals all around you.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.160
Everything alive,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.360
including you,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.200
was built as a survival&nbsp;
vessel for these replicators.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.240
But today, you'd barely&nbsp;
recognize them as replicators.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.640
Now we just call them genes.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.680
They're hidden deep within every living creature,

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.640
strands of DNA made from the sequences&nbsp;
of A, T, G, and C nucleotides.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.720
Now, one of the leading theories is that those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.640
earliest replicators were actually&nbsp;
something closer to RNA molecules,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.520
but then over time,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.120
this must have evolved into a more&nbsp;
stable system of storing information,

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.440
the DNA and proteins we use today.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.920
They are the code that shapes our traits.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.680
We’re taught that these traits are&nbsp;
here solely to help ensure our survival

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.880
the survival of the individual or the species.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.680
But do we have this the wrong way around?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.480
When you have a child, what do you&nbsp;
pass on? The DNA. The DNA, the genes.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:44.640
Yeah, the genes.
Genes.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.880
Okay, yeah.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.760
These tiny replicators are still fighting the&nbsp;
same battle that started billions of years ago,

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.760
and the logic behind them hasn't changed.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.240
The traits just become more convoluted.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.560
Replicators that produce traits poorly suited&nbsp;
to their environment tend to become less common,

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.640
while those that produce advantageous traits&nbsp;
become more numerous in the population.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.520
So it's not about the fittest individual or group,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.800
it's fundamentally about the&nbsp;
survival of the fittest genes.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.160
They are the core unit of natural selection.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.520
But why would natural selection&nbsp;
care exactly for the gene?

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.200
Why not something smaller or something bigger?

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.120
Well, for something to undergo selection,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.120
it needs to have three characteristics.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.640
First, it needs to be able to make&nbsp;
near identical copies of itself.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.520
Second, it needs to exhibit traits that affect&nbsp;
its interaction with the environment which,

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.840
third, affect the probability of survival&nbsp;
and reproduction of the replicator.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.280
Something small like a single&nbsp;
nucleotide doesn't work, because,

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.520
sure, it'll make identical copies of itself,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.400
but alone,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.840
it doesn't exhibit a trait&nbsp;
that could be selected for.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.320
What about something bigger, like a chromosome?

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.120
Well, each chromosome affects&nbsp;
potentially thousands of traits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.960
that could influence its survival,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.800
but when most creatures reproduce,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.120
sections of chromosomes get swapped around.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.280
So a chromosome doesn't stay together&nbsp;
as a cohesive replicating unit,

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.080
and therefore it can't be selected for.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.480
But a gene is somewhere in the middle.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.560
It's a long enough stretch of DNA that&nbsp;
it can independently influence a trait,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.600
but it's also short and stable enough to be&nbsp;
faithfully copied over into future generations.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.200
This is why the gene is the&nbsp;
unit of natural selection.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.760
This perspective led to one of the most powerful&nbsp;
and controversial ways of seeing evolution,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.200
one popularized by Richard Dawkins&nbsp;
in his book The Selfish Gene.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.720
Based on the work of evolutionary&nbsp;
biologists in the 1960s and 1970s.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.440
And as a response against the, then very popular,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.880
group selection theory.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.040
Dawkins argued that just about every trait,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.160
from animals helping each other&nbsp;
to being completely selfish,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.000
is a strategy that helps their&nbsp;
genes survive and replicate.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.840
Genes that maximize their own survival&nbsp;
are the genes that propagate best,

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.400
even if they do so at the expense of others.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.080
Or in Dawkins' words,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.160
we are survival machines,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:02.880
robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve&nbsp;
the selfish molecules known as genes.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.320
Now, you might think this framework&nbsp;
isn't all that groundbreaking.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.760
I mean, take the emperor penguins&nbsp;
in Antarctica for example.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.320
They hesitate to jump into the water until&nbsp;
they are sure there are no seals around.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.160
So what kind of genes could help a&nbsp;
penguin survive in this environment?

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.120
Well, if the penguin’s set of genes&nbsp;
make it more likely to be timid,

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.040
the penguin might stay back until&nbsp;
someone braver tests the water.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.600
That way, the penguin is at&nbsp;
a lower risk of being eaten,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.720
and has a better chance to survive,&nbsp;
reproduce and pass on its ‘timid’ genes.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.400
Here, you can think about this either&nbsp;
as ‘the timid genes help the penguin’

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.880
or ‘the penguin helps the timid genes’.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.160
Either way works.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.320
So is there any real benefit to viewing&nbsp;
things from the gene's perspective?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.880
Well, look at what happens when you use these&nbsp;
two frameworks to explain altruistic behavior,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.680
which appears in a lot of places in nature.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.160
Take California ground squirrels for example.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.040
Females will let out alarm&nbsp;
calls if they spot a predator,

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.720
like a fox or a hawk,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.000
to warn other nearby squirrels, even&nbsp;
though this puts her survival at risk.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.160
The genes influencing this behavior&nbsp;
surely don’t help the squirrel.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.960
But can the squirrel still help the genes?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.880
I think this is a bit more&nbsp;
clear if you think about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.000
fact that most living things reproduce sexually.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.640
Right.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.360
So a squirrel will get half its DNA&nbsp;
from its mom and half from its dad.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.480
So it's actually sharing half&nbsp;
its genes with each parent.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.480
But also, any child that it has,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.120
it's also going to share half of its genes&nbsp;
with the child, but also any siblings.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.880
But then if you take a step out to an uncle or up&nbsp;
to a grandparent, then it's sharing one-quarter,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.880
and then another step out is one-eighth.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.200
All to say, you share a lot of&nbsp;
genes with your immediate family.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.240
And California ground squirrels, females&nbsp;
in particular, they live around family.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.480
So if a squirrel has a set of genes that&nbsp;
make her call out when it spots a predator,

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.680
there is a very good chance that the&nbsp;
squirrels that hear her warning call

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.360
also carry those genes.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.280
Now, as a result of her alarm call,

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.000
let's say the squirrel attracts a predator&nbsp;
her way, and it ends up getting eaten.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.840
This action cost the ‘call’ genes&nbsp;
the chance to pass themselves on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.880
to any future offspring of that squirrel.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.640
But, if the warning call saved&nbsp;
at least 2 copies of those genes

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.400
in two of the squirrel’s relatives…

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.120
well then, in total, these&nbsp;
2 squirrels have a better

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.760
chance of passing on the genes through their&nbsp;
offspring than the single squirrel did.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.760
From the gene's perspective,&nbsp;
this could be a good trade-off.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.880
It doesn’t matter which individual&nbsp;
helps the genes replicate,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.160
only that as many copies as possible survive.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.800
This principle, that altruistically helping your&nbsp;
close relatives helps preserve your own genes,

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.960
is known as kin selection.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.480
And the payoff behind any altruistic&nbsp;
gesture under kin selection

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.480
depends heavily on how related you&nbsp;
are to the individuals you're helping,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.320
because the less related you are,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.880
the smaller the chances that you will share&nbsp;
that particular gene with another individual.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.720
And you can see this in nature.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:03.840
Male squirrels that don't live near relatives&nbsp;
almost never give out warning calls.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.320
Now, there is a big question this&nbsp;
gene-centric view still has to address.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.360
If selection really favors&nbsp;
genes that replicate well,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.560
then why would sex ever evolve&nbsp;
as a means of replication,

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.280
if it throws away roughly half the genes?

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.200
Most animals reproduce sexually.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.360
So why do it, when some organisms,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.880
like certain plants and fungi,

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.640
get to pass on all of their genes&nbsp;
through asexual reproduction?

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.640
From a gene's perspective, this&nbsp;
seems like a much better deal.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.560
When it comes to sexual&nbsp;
reproduction, people like to say,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.640
"Okay. Well, it mixes up the genes.&nbsp;
It's like shuffling a deck of cards,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.877
and isn't that better for creating more&nbsp;
variation? And clearly, that's advantageous."

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.760
Another way this has been explained&nbsp;
is if the genes that regulate sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.600
reproduction benefit from replicating sexually,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.920
then they're going to keep&nbsp;
pushing for these genes.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.800
Right.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.320
Even if it's a net negative to&nbsp;
all the other genes in the genome.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.040
Yeah.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.080
So if it benefits them,&nbsp;
they'll keep pushing for it.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.880
So are there any problems with how The&nbsp;
Selfish Gene explains natural selection?

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.080
Well, yes. I mean, it turns out the&nbsp;
framework comes with a lot of controversy.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.720
One of the biggest criticisms against The&nbsp;
Selfish Gene is that it leaves little to chance.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.120
It implies that every gene present in the genome&nbsp;
is there because it actively got selected for,

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.640
by natural selection, over many generations.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.760
But many genes are actually&nbsp;
invisible to natural selection,

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.280
because they don't really exhibit&nbsp;
meaningful traits in the population.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.480
Yet, they can still evolve over time.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.480
Imagine 20 blind cave fish,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.800
10 with green eyes and 10 with blue.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.760
Since they’re blind,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.280
we’ll assume that their eye color traits&nbsp;
make no difference to their survival

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.680
so they get passed down purely by chance.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.280
Now, to form the next generation,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.400
randomly “pick” any fish from&nbsp;
the first group and replicate it.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.600
If you repeat this 20 times,&nbsp;
you get a 2nd generation.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.600
By chance alone, one color will probably&nbsp;
appear more often than the other.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.200
And if you repeat this&nbsp;
process over many generations,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.080
one color might eventually completely take over.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.120
Not because it’s better,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.520
but purely due to random sampling.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.200
This shift in the frequency of gene&nbsp;
variants is called genetic drift.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.440
It’s most apparent in small populations and for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.160
traits that aren't pruned&nbsp;
for by natural selection.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.000
But it doesn’t only apply to silent genes.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Even when genes exhibit meaningful traits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.200
there is a chance that genetic&nbsp;
drift overrides natural selection,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.760
and a less fit gene will spread&nbsp;
through the population just by chance.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.360
Look back at our replicator battle.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.360
If we run our simulation enough times,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.760
sometimes the winning gene won’t be the one&nbsp;
with the traits that maximize its own survival.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.920
Here, you can see that the winning population&nbsp;
actually has a higher than average mutation rate,

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.040
just by chance.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.120
And the average mutation rate is&nbsp;
also higher than the starting value.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.720
These are simplified examples,&nbsp;
but there is an ongoing argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.240
about how much of evolution was&nbsp;
actually due to natural selection

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.120
and how much of it was up to chance.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.920
Another major criticism of&nbsp;
The Selfish Gene is about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.560
unavoidable implication behind the word selfish.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.280
It seems to imply that genes have agency,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.120
like they know what they're doing&nbsp;
and they understand the consequences,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.720
but it's only a metaphor,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.520
just as portraying them as characters was a&nbsp;
way for us to make the story more engaging.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.640
Of course, molecules don't&nbsp;
know what they're doing.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.360
They don't decide to replicate or&nbsp;
conspire to out-compete others.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.720
They just react according to the laws of physics.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.400
So what may look like intention

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.720
is just simple chemistry that&nbsp;
happens to work well and propagates.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.080
But perhaps the most obvious and&nbsp;
easiest to understand criticism is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.720
that the whole framework is an oversimplification,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.600
and that's true.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.760
Genes are much more complicated than we thought.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.880
It's not as simple as one gene equals one trait.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.120
One gene can influence many traits, and&nbsp;
one trait can be influenced by many genes.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.800
There are genes that are wholly&nbsp;
contained within other genes.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.280
There are genes that inhibit or activate others,

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.480
and then there are even genes that&nbsp;
seem to not encode for anything,

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.040
the so-called non-coding DNA.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.320
All to say, we still have&nbsp;
a lot to learn about genes.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.920
Not to mention that the environment itself,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.040
like whether it's hot or cold,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.320
or how much food there is,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.200
also affects how different genes get expressed.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.800
Genes are much less deterministic&nbsp;
than they might seem!

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.800
So you might think that a single gene&nbsp;
would rarely have a large enough effect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.520
that natural selection can directly impact it,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.040
but it doesn't matter how&nbsp;
convoluted the pathway is.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.800
If a gene has a measurable effect&nbsp;
on its own survival and replication,

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.480
it will be subject to some&nbsp;
amount of natural selection.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.560
And surely, the whole theory is a simplification,&nbsp;
but any theory or framework of nature is.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.880
And what we're covering in this video is an&nbsp;
even more simplified picture of that framework,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.240
but that doesn't take away the fact&nbsp;
that viewing the world through this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.040
lens has an incredible power to help&nbsp;
us understand the process of evolution.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.200
It helps us understand why we see such a&nbsp;
range of different behaviors in our world

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.400
because fundamentally,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.120
those traits tend to cause the increasing&nbsp;
prevalence of the genes they are associated with.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.400
It's like the whole point&nbsp;
is figure out what's true.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.440
Get to the truth.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.800
And this, to me, is the&nbsp;
baseline truth of evolution.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.320
This is what I love about making Veritasium,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.360
is that we get to sort of&nbsp;
unpack and dig under the hood.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.120
And it's what I loved about&nbsp;
reading The Selfish Gene book,

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.280
is that it really opened my eyes to this.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.040
Previously, I'd always just probably&nbsp;
thought at the level of the individual,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.920
but it makes more sense to&nbsp;
think at the level of the gene.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:42.240
The feeling that you and every other&nbsp;
living organism is being driven by some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.640
molecules deep in every cell&nbsp;
is fundamentally unsettling,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:52.880
and seems to remove agency from you as&nbsp;
an acting, thinking being in the world.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.880
Yeah, it's pretty grim.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.320
But whether or not you agree with the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.960
we might be controlled by our genes&nbsp;
and we're simply their flesh robots,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.840
I think it's kind of unreasonable&nbsp;
and unrealistic to go through life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.920
thinking that every decision is governed by this.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.360
It doesn't really do you any good,

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.320
because we perceive the world as individuals.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:22.640
So I think it's very beneficial to see&nbsp;
yourself as your own thing, as your own unit.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.200
I want to give a big shout-out to Joe Hanson&nbsp;
from BeSmart for helping us out with this video,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.400
and another shout-out to Primer for letting us&nbsp;
adapt his simulation on the first replicators.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.520
I have put links to their&nbsp;
channels down in the description,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.720
so please check them out.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.440
And finally, I want to say&nbsp;
a huge shout-out to you.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.000
Thank you for watching.
