## Central Thesis

> "The concept of meritocracy has conquered the world. It started in America. It actually started at Harvard, but now it's conquered the entire world and that's why the world is so messed up." (Result ID: 1)

**The System:**
> "it's a system that neglects the child while at the same time demands the child. Okay? And this is trauma. And again, most kids will be traumatized by the system. But there are some kids who will thrive in the system and the trauma will encourage them or drive them to achieve and achieve and achieve so that they get into Yale so they can compete the Hunger Games so they can go on in life and compete some more." (Result ID: 0)

## Historical Development - Rise of the Ivy League

### Before Meritocracy (Pre-1940)

**Who Could Succeed:**
- George Washington - never went to college
- Abraham Lincoln - didn't go to Ivy League
- "Two greatest presidents in American history"
- **5% of males** went to university (1940)

> "Unfortunately today if you look at the presidents if you look at the top people they all went to the elite schools. Okay so the system is set up so that if you if you want to succeed you have to go through the Ivy League." (Result ID: 6-7)

### The Architects of Meritocracy

**James B. Conant** (Harvard President for decades)
- Brought the SAT to identify scholarship students
- Made Harvard best research university in America
- "Determined to make Harvard into the best university in the world as well as an institution of power in America. Meaning that it would now decide who wins and who loses in America."

**Harry Chanty** (Harvard Dean, then ETS)
- Dean of Harvard scholarship program
- Got new job at **ETS** (Education Testing Services)
- ETS creates: SAT, TOEFL, AP, GRE

> "So, these two together create the modern meritocracy. And as you can imagine, because you're both from Harvard, the entire system is set up to benefit Harvard." (Result ID: 25)

### The Rise of German to American Dominance (1875-1945)

**1875:** Best universities in Germany, France, UK - America "non-existent"
**Post-WWII:** America imports German scientists, dominates globally
**Result:** "Best universities in the world are now America or in America Harvard Yale and Princeton"

### Harvard's Transformation

**Acceptance Rates:**
- 1940: **90% accepted**
- 2024: **5% accepted** (Stanford even lower)

**Endowment:**
- Now: **$40 billion**
- "More money than most countries in the world"

**Alumni Success:**
- **127 billionaires** (2024) - most in America
- Stanford #2, "no one else comes close"
- **7% of all people** with $100M+ net worth are Harvard grads
- Top 8 schools for $100M+ wealth: Ivy League + MIT

## The Paradox: More Education, More Inequality

### College Attendance Up
- 1940: 5% of males
- 2024: 35% of population

**Expected Result:** More equal society

**Actual Result:**
- **Gini coefficient** (inequality measure) way up, among highest in world
- America is **"one of the most unequal societies in the world"**
- **Top 1% control most wealth** in United States

### Social Mobility Collapse

**Graph showing:**
- 1940: Most people doing better than parents
- 2024: "Your generation, you will not do better than your parents. Most of you."

### Cost Explosion

**Tuition:** Way up
**Wages:** Stagnant

**Student Debt:**
- Only debt you can **never** get rid of
- Can't declare bankruptcy
- **Passes to your children when you die**

### Mental Health Crisis

**Depression among teenagers:** Way up
**Key Finding:** Middle class and wealthy students **more likely to be depressed** than poor students

## Harvard's Dominance of America

### The Data (Nature Journal Study)

**Where Elite Come From:**
Looked at all American elite - "most of them went to certain schools, the elite universities"

**Harvard Graduates Found:**
- Generals and admirals
- Philosophers and professors
- Pulitzer Prize winners
- Billionaires
- New York Times bestselling authors
- Fortune 500 CEOs
- Federal judges
- Senators

> "Harvard and Ivory League dominate America today." (Result ID: 36)

### The Cognitive Dissonance

**Survey of Elite Organizations:**
Asked: "How many in your organization went to Harvard/elite universities?"
- **Red = Actual number**
- **Blue = Their estimate**

**Result:** Massive underestimate

> "Harvard people don't know they dominate Harvard. They don't know their elite... If you ask them like, 'No, it's conspiracy theory.' No, you're spreading conspiracy theories. We're just average people. There's no way Harvard controls America." (Result ID: 37-38)

### The Secret Societies

**Harvard:** Porcellian Club
**Princeton:** Ivy Club
**Yale:** Skull and Bones (most famous)

**2004 Presidential Election:**
- George W. Bush: Yale Skull and Bones
- John Kerry: Yale Skull and Bones

> "So, it's a rigged game." (Result ID: 48)

## The Obama Case Study - Hope and Betrayal

### The Promise (2008)

**Background:**
- Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School
- Book: "Dreams of My Father" (NYT bestseller, launched political career)
- **Promise:** "The game is rigged against them... he would be their champion... make America more fair"

**Why He Won:**
> "In 2008 the US economy collapsed. Why? Because the US banks, the US political system was controlled by Ivy League graduates, by just people who were friends with each other. And so they cheated. They became corrupt. Okay? They basically destroyed the American economy." (Result ID: 51)

### The Betrayal

**Obama's Economic Team:**

**Larry Summers:**
- Harvard graduate
- President of Harvard
- Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton
- **"The guy who created the mess in the first place"**

**Tim Geithner:**
- Dartmouth graduate
- Treasury Secretary
- "Friends of Wall Street who came in to save Wall Street"

### The Moral Hazard Hypocrisy

**For Banks:**
> "Larry Summer said, 'No, no, you guys are seeing it incorrectly. We have to save the American economy. The goal is not to save the banks and my friends. the goal is to save the American people and the American economy and that's why we're bailing out the banks by giving them free money.'" (Result ID: 55-56)

**For Ordinary Americans:**
> "And and you know what Larry Summer said? **Moral hazard, guys. Do you understand? Moral hazard. If we help out these ordinary Americans, they won't learn anything.**" (Result ID: 57, Score: 0.660)

**The Result:**
> "The banks got saved. The people got screwed over. And guess what, guys? Because because of this, who who did we get? This guy. [Trump] ... There were millions of Americans who voted for Barack Obama because he promised hope and change. And then they voted for Donald Trump because he promised destroy the system." (Result ID: 59-60)

## How Trump Became President - The White House Correspondents Dinner

**The Birther Movement:**
- Trump accused Obama of being born in Nigeria (false)
- Obama made fun of Trump at 2011 dinner
- Said if Trump became president, "White House would look like a casino"

> "Donald Trump was in the audience that day and everyone was laughing at him and that's what motivated Donald Trump to become president of United States. So thank Obama for Donald Trump. Without Obama, there would be no Donald Trump." (Result ID: 64-65)

## The Soulless Elite - Examples

### JD Vance (VP)

- Wrote bestselling book "Hillbilly Elegy"
- "Possible he becomes president of the United States"
- **Originally opposed Trump** - called him fascist/dictator
- **Suddenly changed opinion** - now says Trump is greatest

> "these guys like JD Vance and Barack Obama, they have no ideas of their own. They're just puppets. They just um tell people what they want to hear. All they know is achievement." (Result ID: 66-67)

### Johnny Kim - The Perfect Meritocrat

**Achievements:**
- Navy SEAL (top military position)
- Harvard Medical School → doctor
- NASA → astronaut

> "This is like the ideal Ivy League graduate. Okay. This is what Harvard wants." (Result ID: 72)

**Why He Could Do This:**
> "In 2002, the police went into his house and killed his father. He was there and he saw the police killed his father. He was traumatized for life. His father was a domestic abuser... he has **dissociative personality disorder.** And in fact, if you look at most of the of all these really successful people, they do have dissociative personality disorder. And that's why he was able to do all that do all this because he turned the trauma into an energy to drive him to greater and greater achievement. **The problem though is he has no ideas of his own. He's just a puppet guys.**" (Result ID: 74-77)

## Summary of Meritocracy's Harms

**The List:**
1. **Extreme inequality** in America
2. **Destroyed school system** - people only care about grades, not learning
3. **Traumatized children** - mental illness rates "insane" in China and America
4. **Death of American dream** and social mobility
5. **Concentration of wealth, power, status in 1%**
6. **Political divide** between left and right
7. **Corruption** - "Wall Street just steals and steals and steals"
8. **Destruction of American identity** - globalization, immigration, woke ideology
9. **Incompetent mismanagement** - COVID, $37 trillion debt
10. **Elite that is soulless, mediocre, and unimaginative** - Obama, JD Vance, Johnny Kim, Trump

> "So thank you American metocracy for destroying the world." (Result ID: 84)

## The Two Modes of Being - Why You Can't Have Both

### Altruistic Mode
- Family and connections
- Helps others
- Leads to **creativity, passion, love**
- Village life, cooperation

### Utilitarian Mode
- Fight or flight
- Focused on **rewards** (like grades)
- Survival, competition

**The Key Insight:**
> "what psychologist have discovered is they are mutually exclusive. It's either one or the other. The other thing that they discovered is the altruistic mindset is what leads to creativity." (Result ID: 116-117)

**Harvard's Impossible Demand:**
> "So in your application, you have to say to Harvard, I have a passion. I will die for my passion, but at the same time, I want to be a billionaire and I will die trying to be a billionaire. At the same time, I know it's important to be loyal to Harvard. So I I will die being loyal to Harvard. **The only people who can do this people are people who have dissociative personality disorder.**" (Result ID: 119)

**How They Test For It:**
> "And they can they can test for that in your application. They're so experienced that they know exactly how you think. Okay? They all like, 'Come on, guys. You would not apply to Harvard if you're not if you're not utilitarian.' Okay? Right? **But you have to pretend you're not. And that's what makes people crazy.** Okay? **Because you're basically an actor. Harvard wants the best actors in the world.** They want people to go for like pretending something they're not." (Result ID: 119-120)

**Obama as Exemplar:**
> "They want Barack Obama. **The problem with Barack Obama is he's soless. He stands for nothing.** Okay? In 2008, he promised people hope and change. The moment he gets in office, he's like, 'Sorry, man. I was just joking. Why did you believe me?' Okay. Then in 2012, when it's time for reelection, he said, 'Oh, you know what? I want hoping change.' Okay? In 2016, he's like, 'You know what? Screw that. I'm I'm I'm going to go water skiing now.'" (Result ID: 121-122)

## The Old System - Real Success

### Before Meritocracy

**The Formula:**
1. **Be open-minded** - recognize you have a lot to learn, ask questions
2. **Embrace failure** - "failure is the best teacher"
3. **Failure forces reflection**
4. **Reflection builds resilience**
5. **Resilience leads to learning**
6. **Learning achieves true potential**

> "And what people recognized was failure is the best teacher. Why? Because failure forces reflection, right. and resilience which leads to learning." (Result ID: 93-94)

### Why Meritocracy Destroyed This

**Can't Fail:**
> "to get good grades, you cannot fail. Do you understand? Failure now is a problem. If you fail a class, you may learn a lot from your failure, but it won't look good on your GPA, right? It will destroy your GPA and you won't get into Harvard." (Result ID: 95)

**No Time for Reflection:**
> "Also before you had time for yourself nowadays every minute is organized for you right you come to school the school day is very long then you have lots of homework and then you have activities then you have to have dinner then all that you don't have any you don't even have time to just think for yourself to just chill and do what you want to do okay **it's intentional**" (Result ID: 96)

**Result:**
> "okay so destroying reflection you don't have any resilience And so you can't learn anything." (Result ID: 96)

## How Ivy League Destroys Poor Students

**For Rich Students:**
> "it's a great system if you come from a rich family because this system trains you to to go into power." (Result ID: 103)

**For Poor Students Who Need Talent:**

**1. Makes You Arrogant:**
> "I went to Yale, therefore I know more than everyone else, so I don't have to ask questions. I don't have to learn anymore."

**2. Makes You Utilitarian:**
> "You only care about things that help you succeed. You're not actually interested in real learning anymore."

**3. Makes You Narrow-Minded:**
> "All you care about is success. You don't want to explore. Okay? You're not so creative anymore." (Result ID: 101-102)

**The Devastating Result:**
> "probably most traumatized people in America are those who came from poor families who had the dream of going to the Ivy League who got in the Ivy League and then they just failed in life because they don't have the ability to succeed. They don't have the reflexive ability. They don't they don't have the resilience. They're not open-minded. They don't accept failure. They're not committed to learning. **They're only committed to success.**" (Result ID: 104-105)

## Professor's Personal Story

### The Yale Experience

**Would He Go Again?**
> "would I go there if I had a second chance? And the answer is probably. Okay, and the reason why is the set system is set up that you don't really have a choice, right? If you want to move ahead in the world and you're poor, what are your options?" (Result ID: 5)

**But For His Kids:**
> "But I do not plan to send my kids to the Ivy League. Okay. The last thing I would do is have them in such a competitive traumatic environment as the Ivy League."

### After Graduation

**The Trauma:**
> "Certainly for me, um it was a mistake because after I graduated, I stumbled through life. For me, it was just failure after failure after failure because I want to succeed right away. Okay? I refused to put the time and effort to learning a real skill and learning a real passion." (Result ID: 106-107)

**The Depression:**
> "Um and so um in my 30s, late 20s, early 30s, I became really depressed and honestly I thought about killing myself and um I was playing video games every single day. I just hid in my parents' basement and so um I was traumatized by it." (Result ID: 108)

**The Recovery:**
> "And it took me a long time to get over the trauma and recognize this is a false system. Okay, Yale traumatized me and I need to relearn to be open-minded to embrace failure, to be resilient, to embrace learning. Okay? And that's why I'm a teacher today to teach you guys that to be successful in life, this is the formula. Okay? **You don't need Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.**" (Result ID: 108-109)

## The Solution

### Systemic

**Best Solution:**
> "the real solution is to destroy the Ivy League. Okay, and there are different ways you can destroy the Ivy League. The best way is to make them public, okay? To make to to have for the government to come in and control them because a lot of the issues stems from the fact that these are institutions that only care about their own power." (Result ID: 85)

**Why It Won't Happen:**
> "So, that's the best solution. It's not going to happen because Harvard, as you can see, it's too powerful as well as Yale."

### Individual

**The Path:**
> "as an individual, your best option is to **recognize how evil the system is and choose to learn for yourself,** okay? Because when you go to Yale or Harvard or Princeton, you think you're learning, but you're not. **You're being indoctrinated and being brainwashed and being traumatized to be turned into basically a robot that's only focused on success.** So you need to recognize this. Be truthful to yourself and focus on real learning." (Result ID: 86)

**The Formula (Repeated):**
1. Open-minded
2. Embrace failure
3. Reflection
4. Resilience
5. Learning
6. True potential

**The Advice:**
> "So if you're rich, go to Harvard and Yale and Princeton because you'll become more rich. But if you're a poor person, going to these schools may be a mistake." (Result ID: 105)

## Key Insights

### 1. The System Was Designed

Not accidental - James Conant and Harry Chanty deliberately created it to make Harvard the gatekeeper of American power

### 2. Meritocracy Creates Inequality

Despite promises of fairness, more college grads = more inequality, less mobility

### 3. The Elite Don't Know They're Elite

Harvard grads vastly underestimate their dominance - think "conspiracy theory" to suggest Harvard controls America

### 4. Trauma Produces Achievement

Johnny Kim case - police killed his abusive father → dissociative personality disorder → Navy SEAL + doctor + astronaut but "no ideas of his own"

### 5. The System Wants Actors

Harvard selects for people who can pretend to have passion while being purely utilitarian - requires dissociative personality disorder

### 6. Poor Students Get Destroyed

Rich students use Ivy for power consolidation; poor students who need real learning get traumatized and fail

### 7. It's Mutually Exclusive

Cannot have both altruistic (creative, passionate) and utilitarian (grade-focused) mindsets - one must dominate

### 8. The Leaders Are Soulless

Obama, JD Vance, Johnny Kim - "just puppets" with "no ideas of their own," telling people what they want to hear

### 9. The Old Way Worked

Before meritocracy: Washington, Lincoln succeeded without elite schools - open-minded, embraced failure, built resilience

### 10. The Debt Trap

Student loans only debt that never goes away, passes to children - deliberate mechanism of control

**Analysis Approach:**
- Full transcript read (756 lines)
- Identification of historical narrative (German → American dominance)
- Extraction of specific data points (acceptance rates, endowment, billionaires)
- Tracking of personal narrative (professor's depression)
- Analysis of psychological framework (altruistic vs. utilitarian)

## Critical Assessment

**Strengths:**
- **Personal vulnerability** - professor shares own suicidal depression
- **Specific data** - acceptance rates, endowments, billionaire counts, Nature journal study
- **Historical grounding** - traces system to specific individuals (Conant, Chanty)
- **Coherent framework** - altruistic vs. utilitarian explains cognitive dissonance
- **Practical advice** - embrace failure, be open-minded, focus on learning

**Potential Weaknesses:**
- **Broad generalizations** - "all elite are soulless"
- **Conspiracy undertones** - system "intentionally" designed to prevent reflection
- **Simplified psychology** - dissociative personality disorder diagnosis of successful people
- **Political framing** - blames meritocracy for "woke ideology," immigration
- **Limited solutions** - "destroy the Ivy League" unlikely; individual advice somewhat vague

**Notable Aspects:**
- Uses term **"Hunger Games"** for Ivy competition
- Claims China also affected (meritocracy "conquered the world")
- Professor admits **would probably still go to Yale** despite trauma
- Sees Trump as direct result of Obama's betrayal
- Frame mental illness not as disorder but as **requirement** for success in system

## Comparison to Traditional Critiques

**Traditional Left Critique:**
- Inequality bad, need redistribution
- Student debt should be canceled

**Traditional Right Critique:**
- Woke ideology from universities
- Merit being replaced by DEI

**Professor Jiang's Critique:**
- **Meritocracy itself is the problem**
- Creates inequality while claiming fairness
- Traumatizes children by design
- Selects for dissociative personalities
- Produces soulless puppet leaders
- Old system (Washington, Lincoln) worked better

This is a **structural** critique that goes deeper than left or right - argues the entire meritocratic framework is fundamentally broken.

## The China Connection

**Key Point:**
> "And guess what guys? Is it different in China? Not really. Okay. All right. So the concept of meritocracy has conquered the world."

The gaokao system in China is even more extreme - professor implies this is why mental illness is "insane" in both America and China.

## Conclusion

This lecture presents American meritocracy as a deliberately designed system that:

1. **Concentrates power** in Harvard/Ivy League (7% of $100M+ wealth)
2. **Traumatizes children** into achievement-focused robots
3. **Selects for actors** with dissociative personality disorder
4. **Destroys real learning** by making failure unacceptable
5. **Eliminates reflection time** (intentionally)
6. **Produces soulless leaders** (Obama, Vance, Kim)
7. **Increases inequality** despite more college attendance
8. **Kills social mobility** (won't do better than parents)
9. **Creates debt trap** (only debt that passes to children)
10. **Corrupts politics** (Wall Street, Obama betrayal)

The professor's personal narrative - Yale graduate → depression → suicidal ideation → video games in parents' basement → recovery through relearning - gives weight to the critique.

**Central Irony:** He would probably still go to Yale if given another chance, because "the system is set up that you don't really have a choice" - but wouldn't send his kids there.

**The Formula for Real Success:**
Open-minded → Embrace failure → Reflection → Resilience → Learning → True potential

**Most Radical Claim:**
Harvard deliberately selects for people who can simultaneously claim passion and pursue wealth and show loyalty - which requires dissociative personality disorder - producing leaders who are "soulless, mediocre, and unimaginative" with "no ideas of their own."

This shifts blame from individual leaders (Obama, Trump, Vance) to the selection system itself - they're not uniquely bad, they're **exactly what the system is designed to produce**.
