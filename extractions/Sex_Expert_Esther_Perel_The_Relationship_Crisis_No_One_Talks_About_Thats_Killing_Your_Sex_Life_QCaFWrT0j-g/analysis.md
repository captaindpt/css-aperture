## Conclusions

Perel's central thesis is that modern relationship and sexual problems stem from a fundamental erosion of social connection skills caused by technology dependence. The "sexual recession" is not primarily about sex itself, but about the loss of human connection abilities necessary for intimate partnerships.

Key interconnected factors:
1. **Social Skills Atrophy**: Reduced real-world social practice leads to inability to form relationships
2. **Technology Mediation**: Screens replace human interaction, creating isolation even when physically together  
3. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Porn and algorithmic perfection create impossible standards
4. **Gender Role Confusion**: Traditional roles shifting without clear new frameworks
5. **Connection vs. Convenience**: Apps provide illusion of options while preventing real skill development

The solution involves returning to real-world social practice, accepting rejection as part of relationship building, and prioritizing presence and attention in existing relationships. Rather than technological solutions, Perel advocates for fundamentally human approaches to connection and intimacy.
