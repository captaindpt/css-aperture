This video is sponsored
by Epidemic Sound.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.580
Sink.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.290
The sunken place to me is
the suppression of voices.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
It feels like the country
as a whole has been living

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.750
in the sunken place.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.590
I got rights to talk, bro.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:19.511
You got no rights here.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.175
You're a 'migo, brother.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.640
I think all great horror has
a social message of some sort.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.690
Do they know I'm black?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
No.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.200
Should they?

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:35.960
What are you people?

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.170
We're Americans.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.450
It's Hands Across America.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.980
Hands Across America.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.900
We still have the
American spirit.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.840
But however you define us.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.890
In order for you to have
us, there's gotta be a them.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.170
A targeted act of
political violence.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.310
A radical leftist.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.510
He is a Biden supporter.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.310
The suspected shooter is MAGA.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.320
Left versus right,
us versus them.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.780
We are polarized because
there is a lot to be

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.520
gained by certain people
when we're polarized.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.890
The big question about the,
the addiction to spectacle.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.930
An absolute spectacle.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.220
It began as the fun
of a horror story.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.470
The sunken place.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.080
It's my favorite genre.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.790
I wanted to have
fun while writing.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.970
Um, and it turned, you
know, in the middle of the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.405
process, it turned into
something more important.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:29.745
By the way, I, I would've
voted for Obama for a

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:30.975
third term if I could.

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:33.105
Best president in my
lifetime, hands down.

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:35.295
I agree.

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:35.915
Yeah.

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:36.585
So help me, God.

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:38.025
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

00:01:42.045 --> 00:01:45.195
Barack Obama is the first
African American President

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:46.515
of the United States.

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:51.990
2008. As America welcomes
a new president, Saturday

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.450
Night Live looks for
someone to play him.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.860
Calling all Obamas.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.960
Your dream gig
is up for grabs.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.680
Saturday Night Live needs
to find an Obama fast.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.200
She is responsible for
everything I have achieved.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.430
Uh, what I can say.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.650
I also think America
wants change.

00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:13.380
And SNL set their eyes on
upcoming talent Jordan Peele.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.700
You had a chance at
the last year of MADtv.

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.570
Yeah.
To get onto SNL.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.280
They offered it to you
because they wanted

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.270
you to play Barack.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.109
For 29-year-old Jordan,
this was a no brainer.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.760
So mad is basically
underneath SNL.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.269
When you're a sketch
performer, improv performer

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.560
at this time, you're not
trying to land on MADtv,

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.780
you're trying to land on SNL.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.494
The guy that owned
MADtv, David Salzman.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.380
Said, no, he's
contractually with us.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.550
For like a year, right.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.690
Or like even less than that.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.440
Yes.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.980
He could have let you go like,
fuck the year, SNL, go do it.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.550
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.255
There's four more episodes.

00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:51.720
But he didn't do it.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.170
He didn't do it.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.000
Four more episodes
left on your contract.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.510
On the contract.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.440
He is like, you know,
they're gonna laugh.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.090
The, you know, the
network's gonna laugh.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.640
Laugh me out of the room if
I even try to bring that up.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.860
Saturday Night Live chose a
guy of white asian heritage

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.020
Fred Armisen to play Obama.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.070
Thank you though.

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:12.524
The hardest part was
when, uh, MADtv ended.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.184
You know, I, all of a sudden I
was, I didn't have direction.

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:21.584
So I went through a
dark period where, um,

00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:24.614
you know, I was, I, I
didn't know what to do.

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:29.325
I came off MAD, very sort
of like bitter from like,

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:33.015
what I felt was like
contractual bullying and this

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:34.005
kind of stuff or whatever.

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:36.165
And so in this case,
my, my thing was like,

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:39.315
all right, convert this
into strategy, right?

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:39.845
Mm-hmm.

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:41.415
I need to be the producer.

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:46.755
A few years later, after
doing like a pilot and a

00:03:46.755 --> 00:03:50.655
movie as an actor here or
there, uh, Keegan and I got

00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:51.615
together and sold the show.

00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:53.175
Life changing?

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:54.165
Life changing.

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:55.685
I don't know if there's
any Key and Peele fans?

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:56.455
Yes.

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:00.375
You wanna see how I
edit these things?

00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:01.245
Get on over here.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.730
These are the videos.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.630
This is the audio.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.370
But these bright pink blocks?

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.840
Music.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.810
So this is a brand deal,
but I don't feel like I have

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.240
to work hard to sell this
one because for over three

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.540
years I've got almost all my
music from Epidemic Sound.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.360
Epidemic Sound is the best
soundtracking platform

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.470
for every creator.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.410
Over 50,000 premium
restriction free tracks,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.770
200,000 sound effects,
but recently, they've

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.760
switched the game up.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.310
Adapt is their new tool
that lets you tweak the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.210
mood and genre of any
Epidemic Sound track.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.920
For instance, you'll see later
I start a sequence with this

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.750
western inspired cowboy track.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.680
Using Adapt,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.410
I could create a sci-fi
version of the same track

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.515
that kept the same melody.

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:44.640
In the edit, I slowly fade
from the original to the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.640
adapted version, aligning
with the sequence's direction.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.739
I did the same thing in
the intro, adapting an

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:52.770
upbeat jazz tune into
something far more sinister.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.979
Epidemic Sound also lets
you download stems, meaning

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.710
you have full control over
when to hide and reveal

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.849
certain instruments.

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.679
Some of my favorite
ever moments on this

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:03.869
channel wouldn't be the
same without music I

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.280
found on Epidemic Sound.

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:07.979
Start taking sound design
seriously and become

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:08.789
a better storyteller.

00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:11.655
Use my link and soundtrack
your content today.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.265
Welcome to the show everybody.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:15.255
Uh, I'm Keegan.

00:05:15.255 --> 00:05:16.365
I am Jordan.

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:17.565
And this is Key and Peele.

00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:17.925
Thank you.

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:18.570
Yes, thank you.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.650
So that, now you know.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.165
Key, Peele.

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:24.195
We like to write sketches
that kind, that only

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:26.145
Keegan and I could perform
for whatever reason.

00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:28.875
Whether it's like this kind of
weird racial exploration,

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:31.395
Christian, I almost totally
just got mugged right now.

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:33.435
Or it has this piece
of physical comedy only

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:34.635
Keegan can pull off.

00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:40.155
Or has these accents
that we can do.

00:05:40.365 --> 00:05:41.935
We are dealing with terrorism.

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:43.845
And what a great
opportunity to be here.

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:45.675
Now Jordan does a lot
of hands-on writing.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:47.745
Jordan will write a lot
of his own sketches.

00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:50.295
License and registration.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:52.815
Holy!

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:54.765
Mr. President.

00:05:54.765 --> 00:05:57.375
Now I want you to go ahead
and treat us like you would

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.545
if I weren't the President.

00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:03.810
Not exactly what
I had in mind.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.200
I started writing my,
my, my goal was to

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.420
become a great writer.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.680
I started basically
writing Get Out in some,

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:15.240
2000, 2000, what is this?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.560
Around 2005.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.560
The initial idea
was already there.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.150
What we have seen is
that America can change.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.635
I wrote the movie primarily
during the post-racial

00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.615
lie, so the Obama era.

00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:32.165
Because together we're
gonna change America.

00:06:33.155 --> 00:06:36.094
When everyone was saying,
Hey, we're past racism, right?

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:36.784
We did it.

00:06:36.844 --> 00:06:37.344
We did it.

00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:40.335
I might be the next
future president.

00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:42.295
Anything is possible.

00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:46.805
With Obama's inauguration
in 2009, America had

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:48.125
conquered racism.

00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:51.034
If only.

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:54.215
In its essence, it's kind
of a Key and Peele sketch.

00:06:55.155 --> 00:06:59.025
It's an observation of
being black in white spaces.

00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:02.415
By the way, I pitched it
like, no, no one's ever

00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:05.415
gonna do this movie,
but here's the pitch.

00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:07.395
A couple months into the
writing and I realized,

00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:09.525
made this call and he
said, go, go for it.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.850
Get out.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.450
Sorry man.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.180
Okay.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.370
Get out!

00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:18.485
Yo!

00:07:19.395 --> 00:07:21.505
Yo, chill!

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.580
I got hypnotized last night.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.620
N***a, get the
fuck outta here.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.610
Mom and Dad,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.880
my, um, my, my black
boyfriend will be coming

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.400
up this weekend and I just
don't want you to be shocked

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.800
that he's a black man.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.240
You know, I don't wanna
get chased off the

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.990
lawn with a shotgun.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.490
The nearest house
is across the lake.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.800
It's total privacy.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.645
Because with your frame and
your genetic makeup, if you

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:55.635
really pushed your body,
you'd be a fucking beast.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:58.185
You should have Missy
take care of that for you.

00:07:58.844 --> 00:07:59.344
How?

00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:00.315
Hypnosis.

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:01.695
Come in and sit with me.

00:08:02.145 --> 00:08:02.685
Please.

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:04.844
If there's too many
white people I get

00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:05.625
nervous, you know.

00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:09.794
How do you feel now?

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:12.969
I can't move.

00:08:14.174 --> 00:08:15.250
Good to see another
brother around here.

00:08:18.044 --> 00:08:20.655
Yes, of course it is.

00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:24.284
You're paralyzed.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.030
Now,

00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:30.310
sink into the floor.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:36.400
What the fuck?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.010
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.580
Sink.

00:08:39.944 --> 00:08:40.689
So help me, God.

00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:49.155
The, the sunken place
to me is the, the

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:51.975
suppression of voices.

00:08:52.455 --> 00:08:55.245
The silencing of expression,
and that, that, that's what

00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:56.475
keeps us from progress.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:01.840
Get Out released in 2017,
emerging to an America

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:05.625
that's racism was no longer
polite and presentable.

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:07.725
It was dangerous.

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:10.785
So much of it is
timing, right?

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:14.595
I mean, yeah, that
movie was a a time.

00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:17.385
You know, this is also
a time when there are

00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:19.875
lawmakers who aren't going
to attend the State of the

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.845
Union because they think
our president's a racist.

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:23.735
I mean, where are we?

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:29.474
The president is a racist,
which is, um, very sad.

00:09:29.714 --> 00:09:33.555
We will make
America great again.

00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:36.375
Hail Trump, hail our people.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:37.425
Hail victory.

00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:42.165
And so I'm fortunate enough
that you know the movie

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:46.605
that I made as a response
to the racism I saw existing

00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:51.990
in the Obama era came
out when Trump took over.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.339
The movie that was about
this one kind of coded

00:09:56.339 --> 00:09:59.160
racism came out in this
time when it was very much

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.939
this loud conversation.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.459
I came here to speak on
behalf of Donald Trump.

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:05.300
You will not replace us!

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.209
That by the way it involved,
to be fair, the critiquing

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:10.620
of white liberalism.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.069
Right.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.590
You know, in a time
when Trump is big.

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:17.219
But I can tell that he has
nothing but the best interest

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:19.199
of this country at heart.

00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:23.025
Like I said, it wasn't Get
Out, it was what was happening

00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:24.555
and, and that timing of it.

00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:26.865
Please welcome Jordan Peele.

00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:31.064
In February, you made
your debut with Get Out.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:33.495
The LA Times called it
a cultural phenomenon.

00:10:33.584 --> 00:10:35.295
Uh, it's on a ton
of Oscar lists.

00:10:35.474 --> 00:10:38.444
Highest grossing debut
film based on original

00:10:38.444 --> 00:10:38.944
screenplay ever.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.140
It soared with critics
and audiences alike.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.460
A ticket selling monster that
cost less than $5 million to

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.930
make and earned more than $250
million at the box office.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.120
For a black audience,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.940
it was a movie they had
never seen before, but

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.940
always wanted to see, even
though they didn't know they

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.870
always wanted to see it.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.140
Jordan Peele knows
exactly what he's doing.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.935
Chris, you gotta get the
fuck up outta there, man.

00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:07.825
You in some Eyes
Wide Shut situation.

00:11:07.855 --> 00:11:08.825
Leave motherfucker.

00:11:09.715 --> 00:11:10.215
Hello?

00:11:11.235 --> 00:11:14.505
It feels like the country
as a whole has been living

00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:15.675
in the sunken place.

00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:19.755
You know, we can, we
can try and scream,

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:24.074
but we can't, uh, you know,

00:11:27.405 --> 00:11:28.035
break through.

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:32.480
It's us.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.880
Once

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.560
upon

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.650
a time.

00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:50.710
There was a girl.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.190
And the girl had

00:11:56.655 --> 00:11:58.025
a shadow.

00:12:01.035 --> 00:12:02.595
There was another 
girl in there.

00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:07.364
She looked like me.

00:12:10.005 --> 00:12:12.015
Exactly like me.

00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:19.935
That's crazy.

00:12:20.728 --> 00:12:23.185
I've been having so many
crazy coincidences lately.

00:12:23.384 --> 00:12:23.884
Jinx.

00:12:24.234 --> 00:12:24.935
Double jinx.

00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:25.834
Triple jinx.

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:26.454
Blackout.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.140
You were in the
hall of mirrors.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.060
She wasn't a reflection.

00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:32.805
She was real.

00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:35.175
There's a family
in our driveway.

00:12:35.595 --> 00:12:38.955
So if y'all want to get
crazy, we can get crazy.

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:46.280
What are you people?

00:12:47.795 --> 00:12:49.735
We're Americans.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.670
They think like us.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.250
They know where we are.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:14.069
They won't stop
until they kill us,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.599
or we kill them.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.640
It's Hands Across America,
a 4,000 mile long chain

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.030
of good Samaritans
standing hand in hand.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.800
When I thought to put the
Hands Across America in

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.130
this film is a an example
of this American duality.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.520
That here you have this
event, on the one hand, it's

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.720
a beautiful thing, right?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.709
We're all gonna get
together, we're gonna

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:41.160
hold hands, and somehow
that's gonna cure hunger.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.910
Hands Across America.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.790
Celebrities by the dozens
joined other Americans by

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.400
the millions yesterday to
raise money for the homeless.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.210
The illusion that we're
contributing to something that

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.310
actually is making change.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.560
And lately people
aren't talking too

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.430
much to one another.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.650
And this, uh, this is why
this is such a great event.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.470
As opposed to something
that kind of makes us feel

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.190
better and absolves us of
our, um, responsibility

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.290
to enact actual change.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.100
It's the line.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.180
Looks like some kind of
fucked up performance art.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.080
I've been afraid of the
idea of seeing myself

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.100
since I was younger.

00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:36.300
And the idea of like yourself
giving you, you a knowing

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.000
smile sort of indicating
I'm, I'm the version

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.589
that was ready for this.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.250
You know, there's, uh,
something chilling about that.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.710
Eleven eleven.

00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:51.390
This seems to be a
group of individuals

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.230
engaged in some sort of
demonstration or protest.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.210
You've talked a little
bit about how this film,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.140
um, is dealing with kind
of this pervasive fear

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.359
of the other that is in
the zeitgeist right now.

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:07.560
Right left paradigm
is the only way our

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.620
narcissistic media ecosystem
sees anything anymore.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.720
Do you think this film
would've emerged in your, in

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.720
your brain had the election
of 2016 not happened?

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.700
The shooter was a
radical leftist.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.740
Right wing Trump
supporting Christian.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.090
He is a Biden supporter.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.930
Case closed.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.780
We know the suspected
shooter, is MAGA.

00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:27.375
Because collectively
we have a dark side.

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:30.765
I, I didn't set out
to make a movie about

00:15:31.005 --> 00:15:32.415
a post-Trump America.

00:15:32.685 --> 00:15:35.445
President Trump, with no
information on the shooter

00:15:35.445 --> 00:15:38.865
whatsoever, immediately made
threats to go after liberals.

00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:41.175
But, you know, it's, it's not
an accident that these were

00:15:42.045 --> 00:15:47.385
my fears were surrounding
this sense of, of us, right?

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:49.575
As a collective, our demons.

00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:51.000
I think about murdering
him sometimes.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.680
Right now, everything
becomes left versus

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.940
right or us versus them.

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:58.090
And then there was us.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.950
We're at political war.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.750
All we care about is victory.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.680
As awful as it is to accept,
outrage gets more votes, more

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.010
fundraising and more clicks
than love and forgiveness.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.860
Anger sells.

00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:14.825
I think what it summarized
and displays is the

00:16:14.825 --> 00:16:16.900
fact that we still have
the American spirit.

00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:21.735
But everything with a
spirit can get broke.

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.275
What's a bad miracle?

00:16:26.655 --> 00:16:27.435
They got a word for that?

00:16:29.145 --> 00:16:29.645
Nope.

00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:35.865
The first notion that,
uh, I latched onto

00:16:35.865 --> 00:16:37.785
when I was writing this
movie was this idea of,

00:16:37.905 --> 00:16:38.780
of making a spectacle.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.250
Making something people
would have to see.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.470
Every Friday, for the last
six months, my family and

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.360
I have bore witness to
an absolute spectacle.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.310
One that you'll be
seeing here today.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.240
Look, this is a society
of the spectacle.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.410
And I think that

00:17:03.135 --> 00:17:07.245
the, the, the idea
of a spectacle, um,

00:17:07.275 --> 00:17:09.045
harms us in many ways.

00:17:09.285 --> 00:17:11.895
This is in reference to
the biggest, bestest, brand

00:17:11.895 --> 00:17:12.795
new live show we have.

00:17:13.964 --> 00:17:18.464
Whether it's something we
are so obsessed by that

00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:22.125
we, we give it too much
power because it's, it has

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.565
a spectacular nature to it.

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:25.815
Man, this shit right
here is our moment.

00:17:25.815 --> 00:17:26.385
Our moment.

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:29.235
Or if it's because
we use the spectacle

00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:31.125
to distract ourselves

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:32.655
from the truth.

00:17:34.034 --> 00:17:34.965
It's gonna get hungry again.

00:17:36.345 --> 00:17:37.605
Does anybody watch UFC?

00:17:37.605 --> 00:17:38.395
The great Dana White?

00:17:38.685 --> 00:17:41.205
You highlighted a
possible UFC title flight

00:17:41.205 --> 00:17:41.925
at the White House.

00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:45.284
Think of this on the
grounds of the White House.

00:17:46.544 --> 00:17:47.745
We have a lot of land there.

00:17:47.745 --> 00:17:50.865
We're gonna build a little,
And my vision for this thing

00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:54.165
is we have this big arch, as
you can see with the lighting

00:17:54.165 --> 00:17:57.314
grid because what I want is
the White House in the back.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.480
We are looking for
the impossible shot.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.390
The Star Lasso experience.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.064
It's also about our, our
inner need 

00:18:08.064 --> 00:18:09.720
I do a little singing
on the side.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.680
Whether we have it or
not, to be the spectacle.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.530
This dream you're chasing.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.995
The one where you end up
at the top of the mountain.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.960
All eyes on you.

00:18:23.955 --> 00:18:27.765
To be seen, to be, to be
recognized for, um, who

00:18:27.765 --> 00:18:28.725
we are and what we are.

00:18:29.865 --> 00:18:31.485
It's the dream you
never wake up from.

00:18:33.885 --> 00:18:36.165
You know people going to come
and do what they always do.

00:18:39.675 --> 00:18:41.185
Try and take it
all for themselves.

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:43.325
Who's this asshole?

00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:46.050
Can I help you?

00:18:47.415 --> 00:18:48.370
You see that cloud?

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.430
There's certain animals
that use mesmerization

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.130
as a primary tool.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.250
Today we're announcing
the Sora app, powered

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.800
by the all new Sora 2.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.980
I ain't never seen
no shit like this.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.610
Where's your phone?

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.700
Why aren't you filming this?

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.300
It's the most powerful
imagination engine ever built.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.840
I don't think it eats you if
you don't look it in the eye.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.639
Well, they made a TikTok
clone where every video is AI.

00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:30.719
Oh, look at this.

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:32.319
Six seven.

00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:37.530
I'm scrolling Martin Luther
King Jr. going six seven.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.800
Like, that's gotta
be illegal somehow.

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:46.679
There's even a name for it.

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:47.820
AI slop.

00:19:48.629 --> 00:19:52.410
I knew it had to be a, a
creature that was a vision.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.690
And that you can't
look away from.

00:19:57.128 --> 00:19:58.702
Don't look. Don't look.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.949
So it looks and it feels
like TikTok, but all of the

00:20:03.949 --> 00:20:07.229
content is pure AI slop.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.970
Can you get back to work?

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.080
Anybody who scrolls SlopTok
for fun needs to reexamine

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.850
how they interact with media.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.650
I'm gonna need to see your
driving license, please.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.490
Of course, officer.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:23.400
My analysis, we
are so completely

00:20:32.185 --> 00:20:34.740
And it's got you when
it, when you do, when

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.240
you do look at it.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.840
I think all great horror has
a social message of some sort.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.320
And how do you feel about the
current situation right now

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.700
here in your home country?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.400
We're getting new reports
about a chilling and

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.390
downright shocking escalation
of ICE tactics against

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.890
the residents of Chicago.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.290
Pretty scared,
pretty terrified.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.520
Um, pretty, uh, um,
pretty frustrated.

00:21:14.825 --> 00:21:17.080
USA! USA! USA

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.633
And fuck Antifa.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.980
When it works it's because
it's tapping into something

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.090
that we're suppressing.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.810
As a society, as individuals.

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.745
Uh, let's not
make any mistake.

00:21:32.805 --> 00:21:35.625
Uh, these individuals do not
just want to threaten our

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:38.655
law enforcement officers,
threaten our journalists and

00:21:38.655 --> 00:21:39.705
the citizens of this country.

00:21:39.705 --> 00:21:40.605
They want to kill them.

00:21:40.695 --> 00:21:42.735
In the middle of the night,
hundreds of armed federal

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:47.055
agents and police breached
fences and busted doors in

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:51.345
an immigration raid on an
entire apartment building

00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:52.485
on the city south side.

00:21:52.905 --> 00:21:55.635
Their agenda is to destroy
the American people

00:21:55.635 --> 00:21:56.475
and our way of life.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.160
They pulled dozens of
residents from their homes

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.380
in zip ties, including
children, some of them

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.640
without any clothes.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.970
And this president is
standing in their way.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.390
At a certain point, decided
to use United States imagery

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.419
from, you know, whether
it's the genocide of the

00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:24.600
Native American people, or
our our, um, our xenophobia.

00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:27.870
And, and, um, and,
uh, privilege.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.900
Millions turned out
across the country today

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.870
for a coordinated day of
protest against President

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.510
Donald Trump and his
administration's policies.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.840
At least 7 million
Americans took to the

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.810
streets, protesting what
many called an abuse of

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.310
power by President Trump.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.560
House Speaker Mike
Johnson called it quote,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.480
the Hate America rally.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.470
We love America.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.720
We hate what they're
trying to do to America.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.635
But however you define us, you
know, in order for you to have

00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:56.895
us, there's gotta be a them.

00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:01.635
I got rights to talk, bro.

00:23:01.785 --> 00:23:02.535
You got no rights here.

00:23:02.565 --> 00:23:03.515
You're a 'migo, brother.

00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:08.175
Tyranny requires your
fear, your silence,

00:23:08.175 --> 00:23:09.525
and your compliance.

00:23:09.705 --> 00:23:12.045
Democracy requires
your courage.

00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:13.245
Simple words.

00:23:13.575 --> 00:23:14.865
No kings.

00:23:16.555 --> 00:23:17.425
I think it's a joke.

00:23:17.425 --> 00:23:18.415
I looked at the people.

00:23:18.475 --> 00:23:20.305
They're not representative
of this country.

00:23:20.335 --> 00:23:22.855
The things that are being done
right now in this government

00:23:22.855 --> 00:23:24.445
are totally ridiculous.

00:23:24.655 --> 00:23:27.775
The demonstrations were very
small, very ineffective.

00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:29.754
Thousands of
protests, millions of

00:23:29.754 --> 00:23:30.625
Americans showing up.

00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:34.965
The largest day of protest
in American history.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.185
All, all my films are
about human nature and

00:23:37.185 --> 00:23:40.815
about something that,
um, I fear is part of our

00:23:40.815 --> 00:23:42.615
DNA and, and scares me.

00:23:42.795 --> 00:23:46.455
Our job here is to say we
do not respect what the

00:23:46.455 --> 00:23:51.075
government is doing with
immigrants today, and that's

00:23:51.075 --> 00:23:51.690
what we're here to do.

00:23:51.895 --> 00:23:56.130
Shame! Shame! Shame!

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:04.889
The sunken place to me is the,
the suppression of voices.

00:24:07.139 --> 00:24:09.990
The silencing of expression,
and that, that that's what

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.250
keeps us from progress.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.060
Anti-government Gen Z online
protests have spilled onto

00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:18.635
the streets of Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Nepal, and Kenya.

00:24:20.429 --> 00:24:23.280
A leaderless movement in
a fight against corruption

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.050
and for social justice.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.520
I've seen it happen so many
times this year where, uh,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.310
really, screams for justice
are, are disregarded.

00:24:33.044 --> 00:24:35.905
The entire system wanted
to suppress our voices.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.169
The death toll now stands at
over 70 after anti-corruption

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:43.649
protests led to police clashes
and a host of buildings in

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.480
the capital being set a flame.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.179
Look, if I see a box,
I'm gonna break it.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.160
The trigger?

00:24:50.234 --> 00:24:52.590
A ban on social
media platforms.

00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:55.439
The fuel, something
far deeper.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.689
They're corrupt,
they're incompetent.

00:24:58.029 --> 00:25:00.689
That's why we, Gen
Z, are mobilizing.

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:05.460
Outrage against corruption,
nepotism and inequality.

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:08.940
This protest is not against
the social media ban.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.280
If I see something I'm
not supposed to do,

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.750
I'm going to do it.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.080
This is against the peak
corruption that these

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.680
ministers have done for
the past two decades.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.378
It's our time now.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.460
Our time up there.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.500
We were suppressed.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.365
Now we have our voice.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.430
And I'm gonna figure
out how to make it work.

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:35.625
You too can be a
part of the process.

00:25:35.895 --> 00:25:36.945
Use the facts.

00:25:37.205 --> 00:25:39.695
Exercise your power.
