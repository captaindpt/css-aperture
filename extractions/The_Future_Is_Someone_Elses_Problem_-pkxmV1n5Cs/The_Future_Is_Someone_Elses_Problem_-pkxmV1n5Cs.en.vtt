00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.320
There are a lot of very important systems&nbsp;
in the world today that with even a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.640
bit of critical analysis don't really make&nbsp;
that much sense. Private equity has become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.880
a multi-trillion dollar staple of the investing&nbsp;
industry, but it seems to make more money from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.480
financial shell games than it does from&nbsp;
actually running businesses. And yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.160
people are still giving these firms trillions&nbsp;
of dollars. The rest of the market is being kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.440
afloat by a technology almost everybody admits is&nbsp;
some kind of bubble. New creative flavors of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.840
are being sold off as revolutionary new ways&nbsp;
of empowering spending. But at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.800
the consumers that all of this relies on are more&nbsp;
broke than ever before. It seems like across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.680
entire economy, nobody is actually making any&nbsp;
money. But everybody is getting paid as long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.960
as they go along with it. The one thing that ties&nbsp;
all this together is the unshakable belief that by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.400
the time this delicate system unravels, it will be&nbsp;
someone else's problem. I'm back. I want to shift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.680
to the debt conversation. Florida's buy now pay&nbsp;
later interestf free loan model may be backfiring.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.520
The financial services company net loss more than&nbsp;
doubled in the first quarter. Valuation stands at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.800
19.65 billion. The Swedish fintech upsized its IPO&nbsp;
indicating very strong demand for the 20year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.160
company. There are a lot of homeowners right now&nbsp;
who can't afford to move even if they wanted to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.240
Trillion dollars this year partly due to high&nbsp;
prices. But let's start with these markets. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.200
we just heard Brian mentioned, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ&nbsp;
record highs again. Okay, so back in the 1970s,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.520
companies had a problem. Their executives were&nbsp;
just regular employees that were collecting a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.560
paycheck like everybody else. Their paycheck&nbsp;
was larger, but actually not that much larger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.200
than a regular employee. According to data from&nbsp;
the Economic Policy Institute, the average CEO&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.080
of one of the largest 350 companies in 1965 earned&nbsp;
just over 20 times more than the average employee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.800
This was partially because average workers earn&nbsp;
more and because executives earned significantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.840
less year-toear. This was obviously a big problem&nbsp;
because it encouraged executives to hold on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.240
their jobs long-term and not take too many risks&nbsp;
so they could keep on earning this comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.080
salary. Back then, the average tenure of a top&nbsp;
executive was roughly double what it is today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.120
And the average company spent roughly twice&nbsp;
as much time in the S&amp;P 500. At this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.520
most of the profits these companies made were&nbsp;
reinvested back into the company itself to acquire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.160
new business, research and develop new products,&nbsp;
and pay their staff. Eventually, shareholders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.560
figured out that it was better to pay these&nbsp;
executives larger bonuses based on performance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.680
especially performance that returned more money&nbsp;
to them. Now, hot take alert, but this by itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.640
is completely reasonable. Shareholders own the&nbsp;
company, and they should make sure that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.120
are systems in place to align employee incentives&nbsp;
with their own objectives. And of course, their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.840
number one objective is getting a return on their&nbsp;
investment. Where things did start to go a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.480
bit off the rails, though, was when a law that&nbsp;
significantly limited stock buybacks was repealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.000
in 1982. This let executives use company money to&nbsp;
buy back their own shares on the public market,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.280
which did a few things. The first thing was that&nbsp;
it increased the share price even if the company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.240
wasn't actually doing any better. When this law&nbsp;
was repealed, the average company in the S&amp;P 500&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.000
had a price to earnings ratio of about 6.2, 2,&nbsp;
which meant 6.2 years of company profits would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
cover the price of the company's shares. Today,&nbsp;
that PE ratio is over 36, which really just means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.960
that shares are roughly six times more expensive&nbsp;
than they were in 1982 for the same amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.080
profit. This is great for existing shareholders,&nbsp;
but makes the whole market a lot more questionable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.640
in terms of true value. Buybacks also make&nbsp;
financial metrics like earnings per share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.200
look better, but not because the company makes&nbsp;
more money, but rather because there are just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.960
fewer shares. Now, another hot take alert, but&nbsp;
even this was arguably good for shareholders who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.800
enjoyed capital appreciation in taxefficient stock&nbsp;
returns. But as the late Charlie Mer once said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.760
"Show me the incentive and I will show you&nbsp;
the outcome." Stock buybacks are kind of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.480
crack for corporate finance. they will get that&nbsp;
stock price high even if the rest of the business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.440
is falling apart or even if they are causing the&nbsp;
rest of the business to fall apart. Stock buybacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.600
started as an alternative to dividends that could&nbsp;
be used when the executive team believed that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.160
company stock was undervalued. That eventually&nbsp;
gave way as more money started to be spent on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.640
buybacks than dividends and then more money&nbsp;
was spent on buybacks than reinvestment into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.600
the business itself to fund R&amp;D or workforce&nbsp;
development. A lot of companies took it even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.280
further than this and spent more on stock&nbsp;
buybacks than the company was making a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.440
profit. They did this by borrowing money to buy&nbsp;
their own shares back from their own investors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.200
which is why corporate debt is at all-time highs.&nbsp;
Now, for most businesses, this was clearly very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.880
dumb. But it pumps stock prices enough for CEOs&nbsp;
to make absolutely enormous bonuses. The average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.880
CEO now earns more than 340 times more than their&nbsp;
average employee. And with such enormous fortunes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.640
that can be made in such little time, it's very&nbsp;
hard for anybody to not play the game. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.400
it's not sustainable. But that's next quarter's&nbsp;
problem. So, it's time to learn how money works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.040
to find out what happens when the next quarter&nbsp;
finally arrives. This week's video is sponsored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.080
by NordVPN, who partnered with me to help keep you&nbsp;
safer online because the internet can still feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.440
like the digital wild west. NordVPN's mission&nbsp;
is to make the internet safer, more private,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.320
and free from tracking, censorship, and those&nbsp;
sketchy moments when a website just does not feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.200
right. With one click, you get a fast, secure&nbsp;
VPN that protects your connection anywhere in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.000
the world. And with Threat Protection Pro, Nord&nbsp;
goes beyond a normal VPN by blocking malware,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.880
stopping fishing attempts, and warning you if you&nbsp;
are about to land on a fake online shop. It has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.200
already helped me once when I almost bought from&nbsp;
a site that looked a little too generous. Threat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.160
protection pro flagged it immediately and I backed&nbsp;
away before giving a scammer my card details. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.880
can also turn on dark web monitor which keeps an&nbsp;
eye on leaked credentials and alerts you if any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.160
your information shows up anywhere it should not.&nbsp;
To try it yourself, go to www.nordvpn.com/moneyut

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.880
or hit the link in the description for the&nbsp;
exclusive NordVPN deal plus four extra months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.560
free. It is completely risk-free with Nord's&nbsp;
30-day money back. So, corporate buybacks have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.240
been bad for workers, bad for the economy, and&nbsp;
worst of all, it's been bad for the investors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.120
but people already knew this, and there is&nbsp;
a reason that they simply don't care. Over a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.760
decade ago, one of the CEOs broke rank and wrote&nbsp;
in an open letter that too many companies have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.960
cut capital expenditures and even increased debt&nbsp;
to boost dividends and increase share buybacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.440
That was back in 2014. in what people thought&nbsp;
was the peak of the buyback mania. Since then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.920
quarterly buybacks have roughly doubled&nbsp;
despite interest rates being much higher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.040
which would theoretically make businesses want&nbsp;
to hold on to cash rather than borrowing it. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.640
that's a problem for next quarter. By the way, the&nbsp;
CEO that betrayed his executive comrades to raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.520
the alarm about how share buybacks had undermined&nbsp;
the market was none other than Larry Frink,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.560
the head of BlackRock, the largest asset manager&nbsp;
in the world. So, yeah, it's pretty easy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.280
blame the rise in short-term thinking on corporate&nbsp;
executives using questionable financial strategies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.920
to make themselves incredibly wealthy, but they&nbsp;
are really just a symptom of a much bigger problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.720
that goes well beyond corporate America. And&nbsp;
there are a few reasons why this is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.000
The first reason is that there is now a lot more&nbsp;
money to be made in value extraction rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.440
value creation. William Lauszanic, a professor&nbsp;
of economics at the University of Massachusetts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.240
wrote about this in a now infamous paper&nbsp;
titled Profits Without Prosperity. He noted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.720
that between the end of the Second World War&nbsp;
and the early 1970s, most businesses became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.160
successful by creating value for consumers or&nbsp;
other businesses. Today, that's much harder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.480
as companies are trying to keep up with their&nbsp;
financial commitments to shareholders. Over time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.480
more money for research and development has come&nbsp;
from the government instead as companies have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.760
spent what they used to spend on R&amp;D on pumping up&nbsp;
their own stocks. Today, corporate profits are at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.120
all-time highs while a record number of companies&nbsp;
are actually losing money. This again is largely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.760
the result of short-term business planning. As&nbsp;
companies price to earnings ratios have expanded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.320
the best way for innovators to get money out of&nbsp;
their ideas is not actually to run a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.000
It's to scale a business and then sell it. When&nbsp;
average company PE ratios were 5 to six, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.720
means it would take 5 to 6 years for the business&nbsp;
to cover its purchase price. Good founders would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.360
rather stick with their business because they&nbsp;
could make that money back pretty quickly. Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.880
some valuations are easily as high as 100 times&nbsp;
earnings. So, founders and early investors would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.880
be long dead before the company has had time to&nbsp;
make more money than what they could just get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.240
by selling. Now, some of these companies could&nbsp;
continue to grow, but a lot of them still fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.680
A lot of them never make any profit at all,&nbsp;
but still make their founders very wealthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.720
Big existing companies don't mind this because it&nbsp;
lets them simply purchase the best ideas before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.720
they can compete with them. And they don't need&nbsp;
to take the risks of funding their own technical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.680
development. Even still, the net earnings of the&nbsp;
largest listed companies in America is claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.560
the highest share of GDP in history, which in&nbsp;
plain English means corporate profits make up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.320
more of our economy than ever with the exception&nbsp;
of early pandemic stimulus. So, where are these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.840
profits coming from? Well, there are only two&nbsp;
customers left who still have money to fund these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.680
profits. The first is very wealthy people who&nbsp;
have so far benefited from stretched asset values.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.360
But we spoke about them in last week's video. If&nbsp;
there is, oh, I don't know, some kind of shakeup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.440
that impacts asset markets, these people will&nbsp;
cut back on their spending, which could create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.240
a bad feedback loop. lower spending by the only&nbsp;
people who can still afford to spend leading to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.600
lower company earnings leading to market drops&nbsp;
leading to further reduced spending. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.640
the market can stay irrational for a long time.&nbsp;
But this is one of the risks of having too much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.720
economic activity dependent on a small group&nbsp;
of people. But don't worry, there is a backup.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.000
The other big spender is the government who either&nbsp;
directly through contracts or grants or indirectly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.640
through other spending has been such a big driver&nbsp;
of corporate profits that you probably didn't even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.720
realize that I mixed up these charts. They're&nbsp;
the same picture through contracts, schemes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.680
deferments, subsidies, incentives, co-investments,&nbsp;
bailouts, financial protection programs, offsets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.080
bonuses, grants, public private partnerships,&nbsp;
guarantees, and intellectual property awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.640
There are limitless avenues for businesses to&nbsp;
make money off government spending. This is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.200
to mention new initiatives like the potential&nbsp;
cryptocurrency reserve which will also largely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.320
benefit institutional asset holders, but that's&nbsp;
a whole different discussion. Now, to be fair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.440
regardless of party, over the last 50 years, the&nbsp;
government has become an incredibly lucrative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.280
customer. Just federal government expenditure&nbsp;
now accounts for more than a third of our GDP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.680
which is higher than even the total war economy of&nbsp;
1944. Other countries like the UK are higher. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.480
here in America, we also have significant spending&nbsp;
done by state governments as well. So, it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.520
an entirely fair comparison. Business executives&nbsp;
are not the only people guilty of looking out for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.880
their own short-term interests at the expense of&nbsp;
wider long-term consequences. Government programs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.960
that put money into people's pockets, create&nbsp;
employment, and promise to solve big problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.160
are really easy to announce. But once they are&nbsp;
operating, they are really hard to roll back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.040
because nobody wants to be the politician laying&nbsp;
off workers ahead of the next election. As Leonic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.560
noted in his article, this has over time created a&nbsp;
system of profits without prosperity. And now even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.200
those profits are bouncing on a delicate system&nbsp;
of speculative wealth and unsustainable government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.680
spending. So yeah, I guess we got to talk about&nbsp;
it. The Doge in the room. Now, the disappointing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.000
part of all of this is that almost everybody&nbsp;
agrees that cutting back on government spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.880
is a good initiative that should make businesses&nbsp;
less reliant on taxpayer money and the economy as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.400
a whole more fiscally sound. But we have now built&nbsp;
such a big debt-filled house of cards on such a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.040
precarious system that walking these programs&nbsp;
back will take meticulous planning over years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.160
if not decades, to avoid any runaway economic&nbsp;
complications. Impulsive sweeping changes done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.320
over the course of weeks to grab some headlines&nbsp;
is exactly the same kind of short-term thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.800
that got us into this mess in the first place.&nbsp;
Realistically, the biggest source of fat that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.920
be cut is the various cost plus contracts awarded&nbsp;
to companies with immense lobbying pressure. Even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.800
those cutbacks should be done slowly and carefully&nbsp;
and probably not be overseen by one of the biggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.160
beneficiaries of government funding. We have asset&nbsp;
markets reaching record stretch valuations held&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.120
up by record corporate and government debt which&nbsp;
can no longer rely on genuine household spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.720
because their savings are at record lows and their&nbsp;
debt is also at record highs. Now, this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.240
short-term planning is nothing new. Human nature&nbsp;
did not change in the 1970s. And before this turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.480
into another episode of Angry Stickman points&nbsp;
at historic financial data, the more important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.520
question is what can be done about this? You&nbsp;
should probably acknowledge that if you ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.000
found yourself as a CEO of a major public company&nbsp;
and you had the opportunity to secure a lucrative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.120
options package by doing a share buyback, you&nbsp;
would probably do it. I mean, I know I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.240
certainly do it. Executive compensation has become&nbsp;
so generous that just one or two years of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.280
bonuses can set your family up for generations.&nbsp;
And if the company crashes and burns after that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.520
it really doesn't matter for you. Kind of sucks&nbsp;
for the employees though. The same basic truth is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.640
true for starting a company. It doesn't need to be&nbsp;
a viable business anymore. It just needs to shake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.880
things up that it gets it acquired. There are&nbsp;
buyouts that happen every single day that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.760
also comfortably set people up for life. Now, the&nbsp;
solution to these problems are the same old boring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.240
solutions to almost every problem in corporate&nbsp;
America. regulate the financial [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.560
CEOs are allowed to pull with their own stocks&nbsp;
and control corporate consolidation. If people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.520
can only get rich slowly, then the next quarter&nbsp;
becomes their problem again. The last big problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.720
is that a lot of people in leadership positions in&nbsp;
businesses or the government have become extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.560
old. There is no point thinking about next quarter&nbsp;
if you aren't going to be alive for it. By now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.960
pay later companies now have over half a trillion&nbsp;
dollars worth of debt on their books according&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.960
to estimates from industry groups. The exact&nbsp;
number is harder to track than something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.600
total credit card debt because these companies are&nbsp;
not required to record their lending practices in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.120
the same way. Either way, this is an especially&nbsp;
concerning amount of money because by design,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.440
buy now pay later loans should only last&nbsp;
8 weeks before they are paid off in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.320
predictable installment plan. But new research&nbsp;
and company confessions have revealed what you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.040
probably already knew. People aren't really&nbsp;
paying off their CLA account. They are just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.440
using it as a new way to make their month go a&nbsp;
little bit further at the end of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.320
Most of the largest buy now pay later companies&nbsp;
are barely 10 years old now. But in that time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.320
they have been able to scale rapidly thanks&nbsp;
to a combination of generous investor funding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.320
a techro attitude towards regulations, and a&nbsp;
service that was appealing to people who didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.360
want to go through a formal credit application&nbsp;
process for whatever reason. The argument was that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.280
these companies weren't giving out loans. They&nbsp;
were just letting people split up their purchase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.160
into smaller payments made over a set time period.&nbsp;
And if everything was done properly, the users&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.680
wouldn't even need to pay interest. But now, after&nbsp;
giving out quick, easy not loans to anybody who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.480
could download an app, the companies are pulling a&nbsp;
shocked Pikachu that their not debt is not getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.880
paid back. Now, consumer debt defaults are on the&nbsp;
rise everywhere. But BNPL has its own risks that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.200
could make this a whole lot worse than people not&nbsp;
being able to split up their Costco hot dog into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.800
four easy payments. On the surface, buy now pay&nbsp;
later services are not a drastically different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.480
financial product to a credit card. Both let you&nbsp;
make purchases now and let you pay it off later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.440
Both offer interest free periods if you make your&nbsp;
payments on time. And both have been embraced by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.840
companies that want to sell you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because&nbsp;
they make it easier to spend money you don't have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.920
Now, it's true that both of these financing&nbsp;
options have extremely high interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.480
and fees if you don't make your payments on time.&nbsp;
And while buy now pay later companies tend to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.120
to hide these risks, I hope it isn't shocking&nbsp;
to you that delinquent unsecured consumer debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.680
is considered very risky and therefore attracts a&nbsp;
high interest rate. But for financial tools that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.720
seem so similar at face value, there is one big&nbsp;
difference that people tend to overlook. According&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.720
to data collected by the Fed, credit cards are&nbsp;
some of the most profitable products that banks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.120
offer to their customers, even including their&nbsp;
interest free purchase periods. The banks still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.440
make returns four times higher on credit card&nbsp;
lending than other products like mortgages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.920
commercial lending, and traditional personal&nbsp;
loans. By now, pay later companies, on the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.960
hand, have struggled to turn a profit at all. In&nbsp;
fact, most of them have been making spectacular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.000
losses. According to public financials, a firm&nbsp;
lost nearly half a billion dollars last year,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.240
which was actually an improvement on the year&nbsp;
before where they lost nearly a full billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.520
dollars. Other companies like Afterpay, CLA,&nbsp;
and PayPal's paying for are harder to get data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.440
on because they are either private companies that&nbsp;
don't have to publicly disclose their financials&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.920
or they were acquired by other companies which&nbsp;
mixes in their losses with profits from other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.480
parts of the business. CLA has raised a lot&nbsp;
of capital from the ever reliable Soft Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.280
to scale its business operations. The company&nbsp;
did claim to have some quarters of profitability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.760
thanks to their creative use of AI to cut down on&nbsp;
customer support expenses, but a lot of that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.080
actually thanks to low borrowing costs, a generous&nbsp;
interpretation of how reliably their customers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.480
would repay their installments, and ignoring&nbsp;
everything else that it takes to run the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.840
The company's actual profit for the quarter was a&nbsp;
nearly $und00 million loss, doubling from the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.800
time last year. In the supposed golden age of buy&nbsp;
now pay later, the industry leader has had to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.600
off its IPO because it's not clear if the business&nbsp;
is even viable. These losses are occurring across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.840
the industry despite the fact that these companies&nbsp;
typically take a larger cut of sales for merchants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.000
and charge higher effective interest rates&nbsp;
on delinquencies because oh yeah, even if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.320
you don't personally use any of these services,&nbsp;
you are still paying the price for them. The way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.400
that buy now pay later companies were supposed&nbsp;
to make their money was by charging a higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.880
than normal merchant fee from the retailers that&nbsp;
use them as a payment option. Mass market credit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.840
card processors like Square, Stripe, Shopify, or&nbsp;
PayPal usually charge merchants around 1 and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.560
half to three and a half% on sales to take credit&nbsp;
card payments according to data from NerdWallet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.960
and the company's own information portals. By&nbsp;
now, pay later companies have started charging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.160
as much as 8% on sales to average retailers.&nbsp;
According to a report by merchant cost consulting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.880
larger companies like Walmart, Amazon, and Door&nbsp;
Dash can negotiate these rates individually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.560
but those agreements are largely kept private.&nbsp;
For many retailers, 8% represents their entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.760
profit margin after costs and expenses on a sale.&nbsp;
So paying that much to a buy now pay later company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.640
is untenable. The problem is that the merchant&nbsp;
agreements to buy now pay later companies forbids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.120
retailers from passing along these fees to&nbsp;
customers. So they have an option. Either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.480
make no profit on sales through platforms like&nbsp;
CLA or raise prices for everybody to cover this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.000
new expense. Now the third option would be to not&nbsp;
offer these payment options at all. But companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.640
don't want to do that for three simple reasons.&nbsp;
The first is that by now pay later customers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.440
are the perfect kind of customers. According&nbsp;
to industry data, they are much younger than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.920
formal credit card users spend more impulsively&nbsp;
and have purchasing power thanks to being able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.720
split up their payments. A report published by the&nbsp;
Harvard Business Review found that after consumers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.720
started using buy now pay later services, they&nbsp;
were 17 to 26% more likely to make a purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.280
Not only that, but their average purchase was 10%&nbsp;
larger than it was with normal payment methods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.160
leading to an overall increase of 30% in&nbsp;
discretionary spending. A 30% increase in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.560
spending on non-essentials is not something that&nbsp;
the average household can reasonably afford right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.240
now, especially amongst the groups attracted to&nbsp;
BNPL. For people who can get access to them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.040
use them responsibly, credit cards are an overall&nbsp;
better value proposition. They have more flexible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.520
terms, they have better reward programs, and&nbsp;
they can help users build up their credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.240
They are also more strictly regulated because&nbsp;
they are officially classified as a debt. By&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.120
now pay later companies have so far dodged that&nbsp;
official classification which means they are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.440
as tightly regulated which means they can give&nbsp;
credit to people who would otherwise struggle to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.640
get it. Now this is not to say that credit cards&nbsp;
are some flawless financial product. They too can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.600
easily let people spend money they don't have on&nbsp;
they don't need. But there are more rules about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.240
responsible lending. Since BNO applications don't&nbsp;
show up on official credit reporting records.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.960
It also lets particularly self-destructive users&nbsp;
pull some impressive financial maneuvers. People&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.920
can get a credit card and apply for BNPL loans at&nbsp;
the same time without each of the lenders knowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.640
about the others. They can then use their credit&nbsp;
card to make their BNPL payment stretching out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.960
the period between purchase and actually&nbsp;
needing money by more than 4 months. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.160
maybe there is a finance bro justification about&nbsp;
the time value of money here. But let's be honest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.160
people are either doing this because they are&nbsp;
incredibly financially irresponsible or because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.520
they have no other choice. The cost of living&nbsp;
has outpaced most people's incomes. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.760
this is going to catch up with us. But for now,&nbsp;
people are stretching things out for as long as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.800
they can using financial gymnastics like this.&nbsp;
Buy now pay later has become just another tool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.880
to delay the inevitable. According to an&nbsp;
industry survey conducted by Lendingree,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.360
one of the fastest growing purchase markets&nbsp;
for these services is in groceries. So yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.080
it's easy to characterize people using services&nbsp;
like Afterpay as reckless consumers. And there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.720
certainly are people being irresponsible, but&nbsp;
a lot of this excess spending is really just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.000
people who couldn't afford to keep up. Even back&nbsp;
in the good old days of 2023, a study conducted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.480
the Fed found that more than half of BNPL users&nbsp;
took on these loans because it was the only way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.800
they could afford it. So yeah, people spending&nbsp;
money that they shouldn't or couldn't spend is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.040
a powerful incentive for businesses to accept the&nbsp;
massive commission that these companies charge for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.080
their services. This is this uh is this stuff&nbsp;
regulated or are you guys what are you doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:33.680
here? Uh sort of sort of. Jesus Christ, the spread&nbsp;
on these is huge. 50% commission. For what? It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.840
our markup for our services. Anyway, if all of&nbsp;
that wasn't good enough, these services collect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.320
a lot of data on their customers and act as a&nbsp;
sales platform for brand partners, pushing deals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.040
and specialtime offers directly to individual&nbsp;
consumers at specifically tailored times. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.200
the early days of companies like Afterpay, they&nbsp;
started out almost entirely as a sales platform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.080
running events like Afterpay Day, where partner&nbsp;
retailers could run sales in a big online event.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.680
This has become less of a priority as&nbsp;
the companies are now first and foremost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.920
a payment provider, but they still use it as a&nbsp;
way to justify their business as a sales driver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.680
instead of just a fee generator. CLA was once&nbsp;
valued at over $45 billion, and investors didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.080
care as much about profitability problems because&nbsp;
there was the potential for incredible profit if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.920
they became the default payment choice for a new&nbsp;
generation. But that hasn't happened. The money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.320
these companies raised was primarily used to&nbsp;
fund research and development, server hosting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.880
salaries, and fancy offices with ping-pong&nbsp;
tables. But by now, hopefully you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:36.000
the problem. The money that actually got lent to&nbsp;
people didn't come from investors in the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.800
It was borrowed from institutional lenders and&nbsp;
then loaned out to customers. Now, this isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.760
unusual. It's the fundamental system behind all&nbsp;
banking. But good middlemen should be able to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.040
more from this group than they need to pay back&nbsp;
to this group. The problem is these services suck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.840
at lending. Picking on CLA again because they are&nbsp;
one of the few companies that have had to publicly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.480
release their financials so far. They have made&nbsp;
$182 million in interest income in the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.120
quarter of this year coming from people who missed&nbsp;
payments and had to pay penalties. In exchange,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.840
they had to pay $130 million in financing costs,&nbsp;
which sounds like they should have made more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.720
$50 million in gross profit just from lending.&nbsp;
Except that people who are paying interest on late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:21.040
BMPL loans are not exactly the best borrowers.&nbsp;
The company also lost an additional $136 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.320
in loans that it considers unreoverable. This&nbsp;
means they actually lost about $85 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.200
in one quarter with a generous interpretation&nbsp;
of their consumer losses. Credit cards aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.240
perfect by comparison, but banks are slightly more&nbsp;
careful with who they will lend to. Banks can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.640
raise cash at lower interest rates from individual&nbsp;
depositors, and they can make money off people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.280
aren't delinquent by definition. For a business&nbsp;
this predatory, they kind of suck at being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.600
predatory. For particularly desperate consumers,&nbsp;
these businesses have become an alternative to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.080
payday lenders who also have similarly low lending&nbsp;
standards. The only difference is that payday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.720
lenders charge exorbitant interest rates that&nbsp;
made up for the risks and then some. By now pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.200
later companies can't really do that because that&nbsp;
would further tarnish their reputation as a fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.320
little alternative to # treat yourself and think&nbsp;
about the problems later. With such huge losses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.640
from the lending side, it means BNPL companies&nbsp;
are even more reliant on their merchant fees to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.960
keep them afloat. But companies are starting to&nbsp;
push back on that. In order to be the exclusive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.960
provider to companies like Walmart and Door Dash,&nbsp;
Clara had to arrange sweetheart deals with much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.920
lower fees to these big companies. This might be a&nbsp;
good play for taking market share. But even total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.480
domination of an unfeasible market doesn't mean&nbsp;
much. Investors are likely to keep throwing money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.080
at these companies because if they can be the&nbsp;
last one standing, there is the possibility of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.560
increasing margins. But that's going to come with&nbsp;
some trade-offs for everybody else. The same way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.360
that Uber started out as a great alternative&nbsp;
to taxis, Airbnb an alternative to hotels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.960
and Netflix an alternative to cable, BMPL are&nbsp;
still in the take market share phase. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.800
these companies will need to make their service&nbsp;
worse and take in more revenue if they want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.920
continue existing. For businesses, that will mean&nbsp;
more fees for the privilege of accommodating BNPL&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.600
services. And for customers, it will most&nbsp;
likely mean more hidden ways to be forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.400
into paying more than you really wanted to. There&nbsp;
are really no winners here, but nobody wants to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.040
the biggest loser holding the bag if it all falls&nbsp;
apart. A tragically common occurrence with a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.840
of new business trends. In fact, buy now pay later&nbsp;
is just the latest symptom of a bigger investment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.960
sickness. The biggest companies that you never&nbsp;
heard of make billions of dollars every year by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:26.000
inserting themselves as wholesalers, distributors,&nbsp;
licensers, or aggregators getting between you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.120
the factories that make your stuff. The only&nbsp;
problem is everybody kind of hates middlemen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.920
which is why entire industries have been created&nbsp;
from the ground up to cut them out by offering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.800
direct to consumer peer-to-peer direct selling&nbsp;
disruptive streamlined outlet platform solutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.200
to make consuming everything an easier, faster,&nbsp;
and cheaper experience. The only problem is it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.240
never really works. And in our venture capital&nbsp;
fueled rush to cut out the middleman, we have just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.680
created even bigger ones. I simply put, we cut&nbsp;
out the middleman. So, we design our own frames.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.760
We work directly with manufacturers. Yeah, we cut&nbsp;
out the middleman and voila. Uber on Monday said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.400
it's cutting 3,000 more jobs in a second wave of&nbsp;
layoffs. More and more Americans are cutting out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.960
the middleman in the prescription drug industry.&nbsp;
We cut out all of the middleman. No wholesalers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.160
no middlemen, no distributors, no importers,&nbsp;
just direct to your front door. So last month,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.720
the online coupon code extension Honey was&nbsp;
exposed for basically being a massive fraud that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.280
would claim referral revenue from its users online&nbsp;
shopping, even if they found no coupons to offer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.280
and even if shoppers were directed to the website&nbsp;
from another affiliate that actually did most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.840
of the work of selling them that product. They&nbsp;
inserted themselves as a useless middleman and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.360
allegedly claimed billions of dollars in referral&nbsp;
revenue. Now, unless you were living under a rock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.800
you have probably already heard all about this.&nbsp;
The original expose video has over 15 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.200
views and basically every major influencer&nbsp;
on the platform has come out to call it the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.560
biggest scam in YouTube history. It's a big&nbsp;
claim considering large YouTube sponsors have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.280
given unlicensed mental health advice, leaked&nbsp;
people's personal data, frozen their life savings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.480
or misappropriated their investments. Hot take&nbsp;
alert. But a multi-millionaire like Lionus not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.720
getting his referral revenue from Amazon is&nbsp;
simply not as big of a deal as someone losing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.520
their life savings on a bank they were told&nbsp;
to sign up for by a trusted influencer. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:23.200
this is not to defend Honey in any capacity. What&nbsp;
they did was clearly highly unethical at best and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.840
will probably be proved fraudulent in the many&nbsp;
upcoming court battles headed their way. But you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.680
would be forgiven for thinking that the reason&nbsp;
it's getting so much attention from YouTubers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.640
is because this sponsor was stealing from the&nbsp;
YouTubers themselves. The art of good business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.120
is being a good middleman. All of the biggest&nbsp;
channels on this platform are made possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.920
because at some point they may be able to convince&nbsp;
you to buy something. That means they can directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.400
or indirectly be rewarded for that through&nbsp;
advertising. The reason this has rustled so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.440
many jimmies is because someone beat them at their&nbsp;
own game, even if they weren't playing fair. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.440
in the interest of total transparency, this&nbsp;
channel is just as reliant on advertising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.360
to pay our team as the other big creators.&nbsp;
And while we don't take sponsorships from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.600
financial firms because of the potential&nbsp;
for you to lose your entire life savings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.560
we honestly probably would have worked with Honey&nbsp;
if we were offered because just like anybody else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.520
we didn't see anything wrong with them. So, all&nbsp;
right, with that out of the way, this video is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.160
about the Honey scam in particular. It's about&nbsp;
what it represents. If you buy something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.840
this stylish personal neck fan off Amazon, Amazon&nbsp;
itself doesn't actually sell the product. It just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.240
provides a marketplace and distribution services&nbsp;
to a third-party distributor. That third-party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.880
distributor buys these products from an Alibaba&nbsp;
wholesaler in China who themselves work with white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.920
label suppliers who work with manufacturers. Even&nbsp;
for a relatively simple piece of consumer junk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.560
there were five middlemen between you and the&nbsp;
person actually making that stuff. If you include&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.520
an affiliate link in there, there's six different&nbsp;
businesses that need to be paid, cutting into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.960
profits or more likely raising the price of what&nbsp;
could be a simple exchange. Consumer retail isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:02.160
even the worst example. Consultants, brokers,&nbsp;
and fund managers, and technology platforms have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.720
all built some of the most lucrative businesses&nbsp;
in history by capitalizing on the golden age of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.560
the middleman. But why is this happening now?&nbsp;
Middlemen are nothing new, but there are a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.200
reasons why it's become particularly lucrative&nbsp;
in just the last two decades. The first reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:23.120
is we have simply mandated middlemen. The list of&nbsp;
corporate regulations only grows longer every year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.480
and so too do industry guidelines, best practices,&nbsp;
frameworks, reporting standards, certifications,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:35.440
privacy controls, and self-imposed goals like&nbsp;
ESG, DEI, CSR, GE, GRC, and whatever other BS&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:41.360
McKenzie cooks up in the new year. Some of these&nbsp;
rules are absolutely necessary and genuinely help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.840
both consumers and workers. Some of them are&nbsp;
just a little bit silly and some of them only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.960
exist to make sure that a group can make money&nbsp;
by consulting on the issues they create looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:56.320
at you car dealerships. But either way, there are&nbsp;
a lot of rules that businesses have to adhere to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.120
Out of this, it's become very lucrative to provide&nbsp;
third party solutions that offload compliance onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.280
another company that is better handled to&nbsp;
deal with it. This both protects businesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.400
from legal repercussions and lets them focus on&nbsp;
where they actually add value in their business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.960
Visa and Mastercard are some of the most valuable&nbsp;
companies in the world and their business operates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.680
exclusively on middlemaning transactions between&nbsp;
credit card processors like Stripe or Square and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.000
banks who are themselves middleman between the&nbsp;
customer and the business that they are buying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.840
from. Businesses could just take cash or work&nbsp;
out their own payment system, but it's just way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.800
easier to pay a few cents to Visa to process the&nbsp;
transaction and let them handle the accounting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.400
computing, and dispute resolution. It's also not&nbsp;
like businesses have much of an option. When was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.840
the last time you paid in cash for anything? Lock&nbsp;
your answer in the comments below. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.080
a small group of people live and die by the&nbsp;
Benjamins, but the vast majority of consumer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.680
spending these days is done with credit&nbsp;
cards, debit cards, or more recently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.240
buy now pay later services. Beyond letting people&nbsp;
spend money they don't have, they are just easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.240
any business that didn't want to work with&nbsp;
these middlemen would immediately make it very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.880
difficult for most of their potential customers&nbsp;
to shop with them. Now, this isn't a problem by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.680
itself. Modern payment providers have made doing&nbsp;
business a lot easier for everybody, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.400
should be rewarded for providing that service.&nbsp;
But as things like this get more complicated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.360
every extra step of the supply, payment, or&nbsp;
marketing process is an opportunity for a business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.640
to gain market power and squeeze out a little&nbsp;
bit more from consumers. Even benign payment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.920
providers with lots of competition are causing a&nbsp;
long list of problems for consumers. But that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:39.120
got nothing on what the middlemen are doing&nbsp;
to regular workers. To kick off the new year,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:44.160
a lot of people have been talking about H-1B&nbsp;
skilled worker visas. These are something we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.120
have talked about a lot on this channel before&nbsp;
because they give companies the opportunity to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.560
employ workers from overseas if they can't find&nbsp;
any workers in America willing to do the same job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.040
Those foreign workers are then dependent on their&nbsp;
employer to maintain their residency, which makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.520
them great employees because they really can't&nbsp;
quit unless they find another company willing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.480
sponsor them. A lot of companies, especially&nbsp;
tech companies, clearly prefer these workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.360
because they have more staff loyalty and won't&nbsp;
argue too hard for a pay increase. The rules and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.080
restrictions on these visas are pretty extensive.&nbsp;
And the rules are supposed to stop companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.440
undercutting American workers and just hiring more&nbsp;
subservient expat workers instead. But it's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.240
easy for big companies to get around. If you are&nbsp;
the CEO of a tech company and don't want to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.120
tech developer money for your engineers, just put&nbsp;
up a job posting paying well below market rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.040
When nobody wants the job, you can then claim&nbsp;
that you need to access someone with distinguished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.400
merit since nobody in America can fill your role.&nbsp;
It's a broken system that's not great for American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.200
workers who get undercut for jobs, expats who&nbsp;
get exploited by the companies they rely on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.760
and genuine immigrants trying to earn their way&nbsp;
into the country. but it's great for your bottom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.880
line. The problem for you is that companies are&nbsp;
only allowed to hire so many H-1B workers. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.600
a new industry has developed where large&nbsp;
consulting firms will hire as many H-1B workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.400
as they can. Tech companies like Google, Meta,&nbsp;
and X are getting a lot of attention for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.560
exploitation of these programs. But according to&nbsp;
the Department of Immigration records compiled by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.200
the New York Times, the largest H-1B sponsors&nbsp;
have actually been middleman firms that bill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.840
out their consultants hourly. This report&nbsp;
was initially published over a decade ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.520
but more recent data still shows that&nbsp;
distinguished labor hire agencies have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.480
learned to game the system. Deslet's companies&nbsp;
offload the legal and reputational risk of using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.440
these workers onto the middleman consulting firms.&nbsp;
And even with a small premium for their services,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.160
it's still cheaper than paying market rates for&nbsp;
technical skills. But the regulations arms race&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.320
is only the first reason why we have entered the&nbsp;
golden age of the middleman. A long time ago in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.360
an economy far far away, the closest thing we had&nbsp;
to businesses producing products for consumption&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.040
were smiths, saddlers, coddlers, and other ye&nbsp;
old tradesmen. These workers made things by hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:58.320
only after an order was placed with them. Given&nbsp;
their basic tools and lack of production lines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.880
they didn't have an abundance of goods that they&nbsp;
had to worry about finding a buyer for. They just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.600
made enough to keep up with orders. This really&nbsp;
changed with the industrial revolution and true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.240
mass production where consumer goods could be made&nbsp;
faster than people could buy them. Over time, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.200
modern business model of a manufacturer selling&nbsp;
to a wholesaler who sold to a retailer who sold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:23.040
to a customer started to emerge because it worked.&nbsp;
Before this turns into a how history works video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.280
every step of this process has a part to play&nbsp;
in making sure commerce is conducted smoothly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.800
There have been hundreds of startup companies&nbsp;
that have sold themselves on using a direct to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.280
consumer model to cut out the middleman. Even the&nbsp;
biggest direct to consumer startups with the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.320
investor money like Casper Mattresses, Bonabos&nbsp;
Tailored Clothing, Movement Watches, and Everlane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.720
Fashion have either faced significant financial&nbsp;
difficulties, been acquired by a traditional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.280
retailer, or gone out of business entirely.&nbsp;
The YouTube channel Modern MBA did a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.840
deep dive on Casper mattresses in particular,&nbsp;
analytically pulling apart their broken business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.880
model. If you're interested in thorough business&nbsp;
analytics, I'll leave a link to his channel below.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.320
The point is, effective middlemen don't actually&nbsp;
make businesses less efficient. If anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.520
they actually make the whole process too&nbsp;
efficient. The manufacturer's job is to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.640
stuff as efficiently as possible. The wholesaler&nbsp;
buys from the manufacturer in advance to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.960
that they have consistent cash flows, and the&nbsp;
retailer handles customer service and sales,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.520
but relies on the wholesaler to make sure goods&nbsp;
are available to sell. The wholesaler may look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.160
like a useless middleman, but they are a buffer to&nbsp;
make sure that manufacturers don't have to worry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.840
about who they are going to sell their junk&nbsp;
to, and retailers don't have to worry about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:37.040
not having enough junk to sell. That's the idea&nbsp;
anyway. Some companies are big enough that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.760
can be both the retailer and the wholesaler, which&nbsp;
is why Walmart and other big box stores will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.560
able to out compete local independent retailers.&nbsp;
Now, eventually these companies figured out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.200
it's cheaper to do the manufacturing offshore,&nbsp;
which meant supply chains got longer and more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.480
complicated, making the job of the wholesaler even&nbsp;
more important and potentially more profitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.800
Today, the only retailers that can really&nbsp;
compete on value are major corporations that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.840
integrate wholesale into their operations or get&nbsp;
around it all together. This has given them more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.320
market power over both producers and consumers&nbsp;
because the barriers to entry into these markets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.880
has become so much steeper. We aren't living in&nbsp;
the golden age of middlemen because there are more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:22.160
of them. In fact, it's actually because there are&nbsp;
less of them. They just have a lot more power. Big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.240
companies have realized it's a lot easier to gain&nbsp;
market power as a middleman than as someone who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:31.040
deals with the end consumer. Katherine Judge is a&nbsp;
law professor at Colombia and published the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.480
Direct: The Rise of the Middleman Economy and the&nbsp;
Revolution Underway. In her book, she outlines how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.120
technology, globalization, and financialization&nbsp;
have all worked handinand to allow a small group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.280
of companies to become middlemen in business&nbsp;
operations that just weren't possible that long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.080
ago. In particular, she focuses on the collection&nbsp;
of data as a tool that is uniquely useful to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.080
middlemen because being right in the middle of&nbsp;
operations means they can access information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.680
from both suppliers and consumers. Effectively,&nbsp;
leveraging data is an incredibly powerful tool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.880
to reduce costs on one side of the business and&nbsp;
maximize sales on the other. Even if you ran a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.280
business that could somehow supply products with&nbsp;
the same economies of scale as Amazon and Walmart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.120
you would still find it incredibly difficult&nbsp;
to compete with them because they have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.120
much data about when to order stock, where to&nbsp;
build retail stores and distribution centers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.280
how many drivers need to work a particular route,&nbsp;
when people are most likely to make a purchase,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.240
and what items should be presented to them first&nbsp;
as they log in or walk into a location. It's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.320
data, and being the biggest middleman in their&nbsp;
respective fields allows them to collect more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.440
of it and use it in more ways. Other companies can&nbsp;
purchase data from data brokers or even use select&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.080
meta analytics provided by the big tech companies,&nbsp;
but it's never going to be as comprehensive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.040
detailed, or as deep as the good stuff they keep&nbsp;
for themselves. The final point that Judge makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.760
is lobbying power. These companies can argue for&nbsp;
more or less regulation in the fields that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.000
important to them extremely effectively.&nbsp;
Votes over boring middleman regulations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.240
barely get lawmakers to show up, let alone&nbsp;
get the interest of the general public. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.800
this is amongst the most effective ways for these&nbsp;
companies to lobby. Now, the solution to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.600
problem is the same solution to a lot of problems&nbsp;
in corporate America. Clamp down hard on companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.400
with too much market power, especially those that&nbsp;
are not as obvious as the Googles and Facebooks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.040
of the world. There is one industry that has taken&nbsp;
this middleman process to the extreme, and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.000
finance. Private equity and broad asset managers&nbsp;
have become some of the most powerful middlemen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.280
in history. If you pay any attention to financial&nbsp;
news, you have probably heard the same line every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:34.400
time the stock market has a little whoopsy daisy.&nbsp;
58 billion dollar wiped off the exchange today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:40.720
$136 billion was wiped off. $5 trillion in&nbsp;
value had been wiped from the markets in just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.320
3 weeks. Yeah, that's right. Every time Green&nbsp;
Line does not go up, we are told some company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:52.160
or the market has lost, destroyed, or wiped out&nbsp;
however many billions of dollars. But all right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.040
then where does that money actually go? It might&nbsp;
not surprise you to learn that headlines like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.680
are written more for shock and awe than genuine&nbsp;
insight. But the simple truth is that the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:07.280
doesn't actually go anywhere because it never&nbsp;
existed in the first place. Sort of. If you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.600
look beyond the flashy headlines like this and&nbsp;
actually understand what they are trying to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.760
you are going to be much better equipped to make&nbsp;
sensible financial decisions when everybody else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:21.120
is busy losing their minds and if they are lucky&nbsp;
enough, maybe even their retirement savings, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.520
This basic understanding has probably actually&nbsp;
never been more important than it is right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.560
because the stock market is breaking new records&nbsp;
every single week. Nobody knows if or when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.400
party will stop. But what we do know is that in&nbsp;
this particular case, the money doesn't actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:43.120
have anywhere else to go. $5 trillion in value&nbsp;
had been wiped from the markets in just 3 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:49.200
Gold prices hit a record high on Tuesday. The&nbsp;
dream of owning the house with the white picket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.560
fence increasingly giving way to white picket&nbsp;
renters. You could buy a house tomorrow if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.240
price was right, if the interest rates were&nbsp;
where they needed to be. Help for the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.440
from Washington remains nowhere in sight. So there&nbsp;
are really three different levels of technical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.920
explanation for what happens to money during a&nbsp;
crash. The good enough for most people level,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.560
the armchair market analyst level, and then the&nbsp;
level that considers debt consumption in all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.440
different asset markets that are getting kind&nbsp;
of weird at the moment. Now, most people don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.920
even get level one right, but I promise none&nbsp;
of this is as complicated as the financial bros&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.240
would like you to think. And actually seeing how&nbsp;
these markets work is the only way to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.560
how messed up they really are at the moment. But&nbsp;
all right, most of the time when headlines are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.880
talking about billions of dollars being destroyed&nbsp;
or whatever, what they are really saying is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.000
the market capitalization of a company or group&nbsp;
of companies has been repriced. This is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.480
calculated using the number of outstanding shares&nbsp;
multiplied by the price the last share was traded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.080
at. So, for example, Nvidia currently has about 24&nbsp;
billion outstanding shares. And right now, those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:56.720
shares are trading at a price of about $170, which&nbsp;
gives the company a market cap of $4.1 trillion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.840
If for some reason tomorrow people decided to&nbsp;
start trading Nvidia shares at $85, then it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.480
have the market cap of the company, and you would&nbsp;
inevitably see headlines about Nvidia losing $2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:13.120
trillion. But they didn't really lose $2 trillion.&nbsp;
They were just revalued using this very crude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.960
calculation. Now, technically, this could actually&nbsp;
help Nvidia's ongoing business operations. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.840
the AI boom, the company has been doing a lot of&nbsp;
share buybacks. Well, they will use their profits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.880
to buy company stock off existing shareholders to&nbsp;
take it out of circulation. They are only supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.120
to do this when management thinks the company&nbsp;
is undervalued. So, if their stock has in price,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.160
they will get twice as many shares for the same&nbsp;
money, which should be a good thing, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.480
Well, this is assuming, of course, that they&nbsp;
aren't just doing stock buybacks to drive up an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.200
already hyped up stock. Part of what is making the&nbsp;
current stock market so strange at the moment is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.320
that by far the biggest net purchaser of shares in&nbsp;
these companies are these companies. According to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.200
the Fed's Z1 Financial Accounts, households made&nbsp;
net purchases of about hundred billion of stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:04.400
in 2024. This was dwarfed by listed corporations&nbsp;
that did over $625 billion worth of net buying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.200
meaning that companies were buying six times more&nbsp;
of their own stock than actual stockholders were.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:15.120
Now, that doesn't seem great, but it's actually&nbsp;
worse than it sounds. The whole point of a stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.520
market is that it's supposed to be a place where&nbsp;
companies can go and sell their shares to raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.160
money to fund business operations. This net sales&nbsp;
figure also includes the company subtracting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.040
from this net number by conducting IPOs. The&nbsp;
total gross value of stock buybacks was over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:35.680
a trillion within 2024 alone. It just so happens&nbsp;
that companies also raised about $375 billion in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:41.040
the same year. Now, this has helped to increase&nbsp;
market capitalization by driving up share prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.680
But that's not even the biggest problem. It will&nbsp;
actually get more important later on as we go into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:51.040
how asset markets are supposed to function. But&nbsp;
for now, for level one, a market crash is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.480
a readjustment in market capitalization. Unless a&nbsp;
company is planning to sell its own stock to raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.720
money to fund future projects, its day-to-day&nbsp;
market capitalization shouldn't impact its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:06.240
performance. Market capitalization is kind of like&nbsp;
GDP. It's a number that we use a lot because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.360
sort of easy to calculate and it's good enough as&nbsp;
a rough indication of if things are going in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.760
right direction or not. Now, a lot of people when&nbsp;
they learn this take it to mean that market cap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:21.360
is irrelevant. A $10 banana is no better than&nbsp;
a banana that's on clearance for $5. And while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.600
that's true, a sudden price drop on anything can&nbsp;
be an indication that there is something rotting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.560
away beneath the surface. So for the next level of&nbsp;
understanding, you need to do what the journalists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:35.680
writing in the headlines aren't willing to do&nbsp;
and actually follow the money. Now, I know I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.960
said that if a stock has in value, that doesn't&nbsp;
necessarily mean that any money has gone anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:46.320
But in highly liquid markets, such a scenario can&nbsp;
only really happen one way. The NASDAQ doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.760
get to slap a 50% off clearance label on Nvidia&nbsp;
stock like Walmart does on Questionable Milk. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.080
way the price moves in these kinds of markets&nbsp;
is that if there are more sellers than buyers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.640
the price falls, and if there are more buyers&nbsp;
than sellers, the price rises. When people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.800
panic selling stocks, they are still getting&nbsp;
money in exchange for their stocks. It may not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.920
be as much as they wanted, but what they then do&nbsp;
with that money is where things get interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:15.120
Let's say you had some spare money. Yeah, I know.&nbsp;
But just pretend with me for a second. With your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.080
pile of cash, you have some options. You could&nbsp;
invest into the stock market, real estate, bonds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.200
gold, alternatives like cryptocurrency, or you&nbsp;
could just hold on to your cash. Alternatively,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.280
if you just want to enjoy your life right now,&nbsp;
you could spend that money on goods and services&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.680
like a new car, a bigger house to live in,&nbsp;
or a nice vacation. All of these activities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.720
that improve your quality of life are generally&nbsp;
classified as consumption. Depending on where you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.440
and everybody else who has spare money puts their&nbsp;
cash, it will increase the value of these markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.000
So if everybody buys gold, its price will increase&nbsp;
as demand increases on an asset with limited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.720
supply. Now stocks, bonds, and real estate are&nbsp;
kind of unique because they generate their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.200
cash flow to give money back to you. Stocks do&nbsp;
this through dividends, bonds through interest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.120
and real estate through rent. Those cash flows&nbsp;
come from other people deciding to put their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.520
money into the consumption pile, which becomes&nbsp;
revenue for these three asset classes. But all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.760
of these other assets really only make returns&nbsp;
by having more people buy in at a progressively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.480
higher price. When the stock market crashes, what&nbsp;
is really happening is everybody trying to grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.120
their cash out of that particular asset market.&nbsp;
They do this either because they think the market&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:24.000
won't generate as much cash flow in the future&nbsp;
or more often just to get their cash out before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.560
everybody else lowers their price by taking their&nbsp;
cash out. Now, if you are lucky enough to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:33.440
your cash back before everybody else, you have&nbsp;
a choice. During a lot of market crashes, people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.360
just want to hold on to their cash because they&nbsp;
are afraid they will lose their jobs and nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.840
else is generating cash flow. But eventually&nbsp;
you will need to put your money somewhere and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:47.280
that predicament is what is creating such a big&nbsp;
problem right now. Sure, maybe you think that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.080
stock market might be an AI fueled bubble, but if&nbsp;
you sell your positions, where exactly should you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.120
put your money? Gold is at all-time highs. Real&nbsp;
estate is risky with today's interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.360
Cryptocurrency is highly correlated with the stock&nbsp;
market. Goods and services are more expensive than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.760
ever. And people are even starting to question&nbsp;
the long-term safety of the bond market. People&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.440
are quickly running out of safe platforms to&nbsp;
stand on, which has got a few people saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.560
that maybe these markets aren't actually broken.&nbsp;
Maybe it's the money that's broken. The way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.720
money flows in and out of these markets can have&nbsp;
a big impact on the way that you live your life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.360
even if you don't actually have that much in any&nbsp;
one of these respective piles. Increasing housing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.600
prices have become a defining financial problem of&nbsp;
young generations, as people can't afford a place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:33.200
to start their own lives or their own families.&nbsp;
House prices have outpaced inflation by a lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.320
which I know is not exactly shocking to most of&nbsp;
you, especially if you have watched any of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.880
dozens of videos we have made about the structural&nbsp;
problems and broken incentives in the housing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.000
market. But the key here is that when we measure&nbsp;
price increases relative to inflation, we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.800
only measuring relative to the consumption pile&nbsp;
here with the consumer price index. The problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.760
with this is that it doesn't reflect the changing&nbsp;
gaps between these other money piles. Real estate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.640
for example, has grown faster than consumer&nbsp;
prices. But relative to fixed assets like gold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.600
it's actually gone backwards. An article published&nbsp;
by Jonathan Hobbes, a chartered financial analyst,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.000
compiled this data to show that if you were paying&nbsp;
for the average American house today in gold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.160
you would be spending about half as much as&nbsp;
you would have been back in 1991 and roughly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.120
a quarter of what you would have been paying in&nbsp;
the early 2000s. Now the article itself used this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:26.000
data to build a case for just buying gold. But&nbsp;
the reality is basically any assets would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.280
had the same effect. If you were paying in S&amp;P 500&nbsp;
indexes, the relative fall in house prices would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.880
have been even greater. So there were two lessons&nbsp;
from this. One is that investing is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.120
I hope you already knew that. But the deeper&nbsp;
lesson here is that it's become much easier for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.160
people with lots of money in these piles to buy&nbsp;
basically anything they want from these piles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.560
There is only so much money that people can spend&nbsp;
on consumption. So wealthy people naturally throw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.960
the rest into one of these. As they have grown,&nbsp;
they've provided more money to people who own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.320
them. And since most of them were already maxing&nbsp;
out what they could throw into consumption,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.560
they put even more back into these piles,&nbsp;
creating a feedback loop of wealth generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:07.120
A basic look at the historic numbers makes this&nbsp;
pretty clear. Market returns over the past 60&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:13.280
years have averaged just over 10%. And inflation&nbsp;
has averaged just over 4%. If you include taxes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.600
this generally means if you can consume less&nbsp;
than 4% of your invested assets annually, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.320
can live forever without touching your principal.&nbsp;
This basic arithmetic is the foundation of things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.960
like the financial independence retire early&nbsp;
movement. But for extremely wealthy people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.360
can easily afford to live on less than 4% of their&nbsp;
net worth, they can compound wealth faster than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.080
they can spend it. Now compare this to most people&nbsp;
who earn their income by selling their time. Most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.800
wage increases are indexed to consumer prices if&nbsp;
you are lucky, which has been the slowest growing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.440
one of these piles. This has made it harder and&nbsp;
harder for the wages to compete when both groups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.680
want to put their money into the same area. A lot&nbsp;
of what the wealthy are buying is different from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.800
what working people are buying. But there are some&nbsp;
areas where these cross over. Real estate is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.360
the most obvious and socially destabilizing&nbsp;
example of that. The reason this is happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.160
now is that the growth in these asset piles has&nbsp;
become unprecedented. We have been paying a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.400
of attention to what the money printer has done to&nbsp;
consumer prices, but these other money piles have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:14.000
soaked up much of the excess cash and it has put&nbsp;
non-asset owners further behind. Now, the point of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.960
this is not that inequality has become worse. You&nbsp;
already knew that. But a new problem coming from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.120
that is how these increasingly consolidated&nbsp;
markets are behaving. According to the Fed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.440
participation in the stock market is approaching&nbsp;
all-time highs, which sounds like a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.040
But this has mainly been driven by lots of&nbsp;
people investing very small amounts of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.600
through platforms with low fees and low barriers&nbsp;
to entry like Robin Hood. The real money in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.160
asset markets is more consolidated than it has&nbsp;
ever been. With the top 10% of households owning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:46.000
93% of all equities the last time this data was&nbsp;
collected at the end of 2024. In a market panic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.840
the reason why people sell their assets is because&nbsp;
they want to make sure they have enough cash on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.680
hand to cover their most basic consumption&nbsp;
needs if they lose their source of income,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.120
which for most people is their job. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
job losses and market downturns often go hand in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.840
hand. However, as these assets have become more&nbsp;
consolidated amongst people who can easily cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:08.080
their living expenses several times over, there&nbsp;
have consistently been more people with lots of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.240
spare cash to buy in versus the people that&nbsp;
need to sell out to cover themselves in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:17.040
hard time. Put another way, if unemployment was to&nbsp;
hypothetically spike tomorrow for any particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.520
reason, most of the people losing their jobs would&nbsp;
not have a meaningful pile of assets to sell to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.400
cover themselves while they were looking for a new&nbsp;
job. And it's not like we would miss the consumers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:31.680
either. A majority of the consumer spending in the&nbsp;
economy now comes from the top 10% of households.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.880
And corporate profits are primarily driven by&nbsp;
selling stuff to other corporations. Sounds pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:42.320
bad, right? Well, it gets worse. Remember those&nbsp;
record setting stock buybacks from earlier? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:46.400
they have outnumbered net household share&nbsp;
purchases 6 to1, adding even more people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.200
to the side piling money in. If you add this to&nbsp;
the rise of index funds that mindlessly buy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.320
hold a broad selection of shares, it's easy to see&nbsp;
how lopsided the market has become. Now, this does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.200
not mean that markets can't fall. But what it does&nbsp;
mean is that they can stretch far further and stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.840
irrational far longer than they could ever before.&nbsp;
And while they do, they are throwing off money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.840
like never before for people to buy up every other&nbsp;
asset market. Sounds pretty bad, right? Well, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.880
gets worse. A huge amount of this money recently&nbsp;
has been tied up in chasing returns from AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.320
These companies have spent trillions of dollars on&nbsp;
this project so far. Late last week, everybody's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:27.360
least favorite tech priest, T-Rex, Sam Alman,&nbsp;
said the quiet part out loud when he suggested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.880
that AI and the industry surrounding it might be&nbsp;
in a bit of a bubble. This simultaneously shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:39.040
absolutely everyone and absolutely nobody at the&nbsp;
same time. The value of the entire stock market&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:44.560
has nearly doubled over the last 5 years. This has&nbsp;
been driven almost entirely by just 10 companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:50.000
whose growth was in turn driven almost entirely&nbsp;
by the promise of AI. Most people understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.040
this isn't sustainable. But they also understand&nbsp;
that technology like this has changed the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.000
before. Improvements are slowing down as new&nbsp;
models are showing disappointing improvements. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.200
every day we are discovering new things we can do&nbsp;
with these products. For every argument there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:10.080
counterargument. You don't need to watch another&nbsp;
video speculating about the future of AI because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:16.240
the truth is nobody has a damn clue. But what we&nbsp;
can do is look back over these last three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:22.400
and find out how much this whole game has cost&nbsp;
us because the numbers are not good. It's almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.960
like investors are saying 100 million isn't enough&nbsp;
to make it too. And we're told that Zuckerberg at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.960
that time really said okay I'm thrilled we get&nbsp;
to do this in the United States of America. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.080
think this will be the most important project of&nbsp;
this era. that the dormant nuclear reactors at 3M&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:42.560
island because decades after a partial reactor&nbsp;
meltdown shut down part of the facility. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.040
so everybody has been paying a lot of attention&nbsp;
to the astronomical valuations that have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.440
assigned to everything, even partially AI related.&nbsp;
And they have also been paying attention to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:56.560
billions of dollars in value vanishing into thin&nbsp;
air whenever Jensen Huang sneezes the wrong way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:01.280
Now, to be fair, we kind of have to pay attention&nbsp;
to it because that's all of our retirement savings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.960
tied up in this fun little game. But all of this&nbsp;
value probably means a lot less than you think.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.600
Market capitalization, which is what most AI&nbsp;
headlines focus on, is simply a calculation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.080
of how many shares are in circulation multiplied&nbsp;
by what number the last speculator in line made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:22.320
a trade at. If Nvidia has in value, that doesn't&nbsp;
mean that $2 trillion has been destroyed. It just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:27.120
means we have put a new price tag on what this&nbsp;
business does. Just like if Walmart marks down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:33.760
a banana from $10 to $5, it hasn't destroyed $5.&nbsp;
The actual numbers we should be paying attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.640
to are the actual resources that we have put into&nbsp;
this system versus what we have gotten back out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:45.040
And by resources, you can't just think of cash.&nbsp;
Cash is really just the receipt for resources. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:50.080
while dollars are a great unit to tally everything&nbsp;
up, what we should instead be keeping track of is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:55.280
how many cold, hard, tangible Age of Empire style&nbsp;
resources we have used to fuel this one particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.960
tech tree. Because only then can we find out if&nbsp;
this is really making the world a richer place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.760
All right. So, how do we do that? Well, we&nbsp;
can start from a simple analysis of the direct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.480
business expenses taken on by companies desperate&nbsp;
to stay ahead of their competitors. And after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.440
that, we can work down to the less tangible stuff,&nbsp;
like the opportunity cost of sanctioning China&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:20.560
over AI chips or dedicating some of the world's&nbsp;
best researchers to producing whatever the hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:27.440
this is. The first major major resource being used&nbsp;
to fuel this machine is the most obvious one, all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:32.960
of those chips. In our Amazon video released just&nbsp;
a month ago, the tally for AI capital expenditure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:38.640
amongst just four of the top tech companies had&nbsp;
reached $200 billion for the year and $60 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.760
for the most recent reported quarter alone. But&nbsp;
since that video went live, new filings have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.640
come out. And now, according to company reports&nbsp;
collated by Bloomberg, spending for this year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:56.960
is already on track to hit $344 billion. That is&nbsp;
more than 1% of America's entire GDP being used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:01.600
building compute infrastructure to develop and&nbsp;
operate new models. Now, if this sounds just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.040
little bit dumb to you, don't worry. It's actually&nbsp;
worse than you think. For one thing, this number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:12.480
only includes the top four tracked public firms.&nbsp;
Meta, Google, Microsoft, and the biggest spender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:18.240
of all, Amazon. Smaller businesses or private&nbsp;
companies like OpenAI are not included in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:22.160
numbers because they don't have to release&nbsp;
financial information. But from the outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.800
we can still make some educated guesses. The&nbsp;
scale and frequency of fundraising taking place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:31.840
at OpenAI, the makers of Chat GPT, is growing&nbsp;
exponentially every year, even as they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:37.440
started squeezing out revenue. In March this year,&nbsp;
the company received $40 billion from investors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:43.120
in the largest private tech deal in history. And&nbsp;
then just 4 months later, they raised another $8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.840
billion. Every time they do this, their existing&nbsp;
investors are giving up some of their stake in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:52.560
the company. So the only reason they would go&nbsp;
ahead with it is if they really needed the money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.520
which they do, mostly to keep on building new&nbsp;
compute capacity. The second reason this spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:02.720
is probably even worse than it looks, has a lot&nbsp;
to do with accounting. Capital expenditure just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:07.520
means businesses spending money on fixed assets&nbsp;
like land, vehicles, and in this instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.640
gigantic data centers. For the accountants, this&nbsp;
distinction is important because if a company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.720
makes a million dollars in gross profit and&nbsp;
then spends a million dollars buying a building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.320
it doesn't get to subtract the total purchase&nbsp;
from its revenue upfront like it would if it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.520
spent a million dollars on a regular expense like&nbsp;
salaries. Instead, they have to use a depreciation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.840
schedule, which accounts for how much value an&nbsp;
item loses with every year of use in line with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.280
industry standards. For server equipment, that is&nbsp;
5 years. Which means if a company spent a million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.960
dollars on a fancy new rack of Nvidia GPUs, they&nbsp;
would only be able to claim $200,000 a year as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.560
actual expenses against their taxes. Normally,&nbsp;
companies want to maximize this appreciation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:51.440
to minimize their tax liability, artificially&nbsp;
making things look worse in the business than they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:57.920
actually are as far as the IRS is concerned. But&nbsp;
right now, they are kind of doing the opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.280
Chips that were state-of-the-art in 2022 when&nbsp;
Chad GPT first launched are almost completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:08.400
useless in today's modern AI data centers and&nbsp;
are largely not even worth the energy to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.640
It's highly unlikely that the billions of dollars&nbsp;
in chips that they are buying right now are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:16.960
to take 5 years to fully depreciate, even though&nbsp;
that is what it's going to say on their official&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.680
financial statements. This treadmill of technology&nbsp;
has created a higher level of spending than any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.000
other project in history. And what is easy to&nbsp;
forget with all of these insane numbers being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.200
thrown around is that these are resources that&nbsp;
could have been used elsewhere. One way that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:36.880
could interpret these numbers is that the rapidly&nbsp;
escalating AI arms race has become an incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.840
efficient machine that turns investor dollars&nbsp;
into e-waste with a byproduct of brain rot. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:46.560
maybe we are getting ahead of ourselves. So far,&nbsp;
total spending on just this technical hardware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.760
alone has amounted to around a trillion dollars&nbsp;
by just these four companies. According to data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:57.360
from Stanford, Chinese state-owned enterprises&nbsp;
have invested an additional $500 billion into AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.400
infrastructure. And then every other organization&nbsp;
in the world that isn't Amazon, Meta, Google,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:07.600
or Microsoft has dropped in another half trillion&nbsp;
working backwards off the sales data from Nvidia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:12.320
and AMD. But that's just the first item on the&nbsp;
budget sheet. And these companies are finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.440
out the hardware is the cheap part. The costs&nbsp;
of getting AI to where it is now have already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:23.040
been staggering. But when you do a costbenefit&nbsp;
analysis, it's also important to look at, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:29.040
the benefits. The only problem is those benefits&nbsp;
have been surprisingly hard to find. A report by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:34.720
MIT tracked 300 companies implementing generative&nbsp;
AI into their workflows on an enterprise level.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.280
Despite an additional 30 to40 billion of&nbsp;
investment, which we can add to the tally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:45.840
the study found that 95% of the organizations&nbsp;
generated zero returns from AI. Now, for what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:51.840
it's worth, I would like to say that I don't want&nbsp;
to completely ride off AI, even though I know it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:57.360
sometimes really easy to hate on how it's being&nbsp;
sold to the world. AI, like most new technologies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.840
is coming along with a bit too much hype. But&nbsp;
underneath that, there are some cool things you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.880
can do with it. I know I have used this example&nbsp;
before, but even here at Little O Works Media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.160
Group, we used to spend hours every week cutting&nbsp;
out images to use as assets in our videos. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.800
most of that can be done with AI tools letting our&nbsp;
editors actually work on something creative or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:21.040
you know, just getting some time to go out&nbsp;
and touch grass. These are real practical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:26.080
tools that have helped make someone's working day&nbsp;
easier, more productive, and less monotonous. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:31.600
problem with this, though, is that when companies,&nbsp;
governments, and uh nonprofit organizations have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:36.160
poured trillions of dollars into developing this&nbsp;
technology, useful, practical tools are not good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:40.880
enough. Companies want to be able to replace&nbsp;
their workforce, not make their work slightly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:46.640
easier. Governments want a super intelligence, not&nbsp;
something that can trim out JPEGs. And honestly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:51.600
I don't even want to know what someone like Peter&nbsp;
Teal wants. You would prefer the human race to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:51.600 --> 01:00:01.200
endure, right? Uh, you're hesitating. Well, I&nbsp;
Yes. I don't know. I I would uh Yes. Okay. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.080
but whatever these grand ambitions end up being,&nbsp;
the bill is adding up. And we haven't even got to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.840
the big expense yet, energy. Earlier this month,&nbsp;
a group of AI researchers started making headlines&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.280
after they returned from a tour of facilities in&nbsp;
China. Their claim was that America had probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:22.000
already lost the AI arms race. Not because&nbsp;
China had better technology or researchers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.160
but because they had an actual functional&nbsp;
electric grid. According to the Department&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.760
of Energy in a report, the foundation of America's&nbsp;
electrical grids were built in the 1960s and 70s,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.480
and a lot of the infrastructure is still being&nbsp;
used today, well past the end of its intended&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:42.000
life cycle. China has industrialized much more&nbsp;
recently than we have here in America. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
while our grid is barely holding on, they have&nbsp;
had the advantage of practically building theirs&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.120
from scratch with more modern technology. Now,&nbsp;
this still hasn't been cheap for them. But since&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.840
the 1990s, while America's economy has been&nbsp;
primarily fueled by consumer spending, China's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.640
has grown on exports and construction. According&nbsp;
to their national statistics and corroborated by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:06.640
Bloomberg Intelligence, the country spent nearly&nbsp;
$2.3 trillion on infrastructure in 2022 alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.160
compared to $1.1 trillion worth of spending&nbsp;
in the US, spread out over 5 years. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.200
not to say what China is doing is a good idea&nbsp;
either. This kind of spending has put them in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.800
potentially ruinous amount of debt. But the reason&nbsp;
this is important for the AI discussion is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.920
Chinese grids frequently run with energy reserve&nbsp;
margins of 100%. Which means it has twice the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.440
energy capacity it needs. Whereas in America, we&nbsp;
operate with margins of just 15% according to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:38.240
researchers who made this report. That means that&nbsp;
AI data centers in China are actually a useful way&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.440
to soak up extra energy capacity. While the same&nbsp;
facilities here in America are a strain on already&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.480
crumbling infrastructure. The International Energy&nbsp;
Agency estimates that data centers accounted for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:54.560
1.5% of the world's electricity consumption&nbsp;
in 2024 and is projected to double by 2030 if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.760
current trends continue with AI. If you were to&nbsp;
get that out of your outlet at home, 450 terowatt&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:05.040
hours spread out over the last 3 years only would&nbsp;
have cost you around $18 billion, assuming you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.960
were able to negotiate wholesale rates of about&nbsp;
$40 per megawatt hour. That's actually not bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.320
but it's far from the whole story. That's&nbsp;
just the cost that the AI operators will pay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.440
not everybody else. You've probably noticed that&nbsp;
your electricity has become more expensive over&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.720
recent months. Or maybe you haven't because let's&nbsp;
be honest, everything has become more expensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.400
over recent months. But anyway, I want to play a&nbsp;
little game. This is average energy prices across&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.320
American cities according to the BLS. Can you see&nbsp;
anything that stands out? Let me give you a hint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:45.600
Major AI development really kicked off right here.&nbsp;
Now, the war in Ukraine, more EVs, and overall&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:51.440
inflation played a part in this, too. But here in&nbsp;
America, we never really relied on Russian energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.960
Before the recent surge in AI, electricity prices&nbsp;
were actually declining compared to inflation. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.920
now, they have almost doubled within the last 3&nbsp;
years alone. This is costing us all in more ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.720
than just the big, beautiful energy bills we have&nbsp;
to deal with every month. Other industries like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.920
manufacturing also use a lot of energy and if they&nbsp;
have to pay twice as much for this crucial input,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.240
they are going to pass those costs along to&nbsp;
all of us and be less competitive in global&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.960
markets. According to the Energy Information&nbsp;
Administration, use electricity expenditures&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.280
totaled $419 billion in 2021 before this jump.&nbsp;
They have not published data on 2024 yet. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.240
if we are using more electricity and paying almost&nbsp;
twice as much for it, the actual cost felt across&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:38.400
the economy is easily an additional $400 billion.&nbsp;
Again, this is just in America. Now, some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.360
largest AI players have responded to these market&nbsp;
conditions by just commissioning their own power&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.480
plants. But other businesses are pursuing a more&nbsp;
tried and tested approach, begging the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.600
to fix their problems for them. Big tech companies&nbsp;
have been lobbying hard to get money allocated to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.840
upgrade energy infrastructure. They are using&nbsp;
the threat of moving their operations offshore&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.000
if their needs aren't met, which is an effective&nbsp;
message since the government sees this as such a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.640
strategic industry. Now, if we end up getting&nbsp;
a better electrical grid because some big tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.040
companies wanted it, maybe that might actually&nbsp;
be an example of political lobbying accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.160
doing some good. But according to the University&nbsp;
of Texas Energy Institute report, this could take&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.720
trillions of dollars. And nobody is arguing that&nbsp;
the grid doesn't need an upgrade. The problem is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.800
that nobody else is getting a say as to whether&nbsp;
there are better places to be spending that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:31.200
first. Places like, oh, I don't know, bailing out&nbsp;
private equity when they inevitably explode. 20&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.800
years ago, if you asked the average person what&nbsp;
they thought about private equity, they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.200
probably have no idea what you were talking&nbsp;
about. The business was a small, unglamorous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.040
and overlooked side of finance that people went&nbsp;
into if they couldn't land a job at a hedge fund&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.000
where the real money was made. Since then though,&nbsp;
changes in regulations, investor preferences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.240
and the availability of cash has allowed the&nbsp;
industry to grow to over 20 times its size&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:57.600
back in 2000. In that time, it meant dozens of&nbsp;
billionaires, acquired millions of businesses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.880
developed a bad reputation, and simply grown too&nbsp;
big for its own good. The thing that originally&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.640
made private equity a competitive investment&nbsp;
was its small-sized and understated operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.760
But not unlike a parasite that has outgrown its&nbsp;
host, the biggest threat to private equity today&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.960
is private equity. Deals are getting harder&nbsp;
to find, fees are getting harder to justify,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.040
and returns are simply not worth the risk.&nbsp;
Now, I know that you might think this sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.920
like a problem for wealthy investors and asset&nbsp;
managers, not you. But the whole system only&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.160
works by borrowing a lot of money through business&nbsp;
structures that look like this, and assuming that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.080
things will keep growing forever. If that&nbsp;
doesn't happen, there are now trillions of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.640
dollars in loans that could go bad. And I'm sorry&nbsp;
to be the one to tell you, but that is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:46.000
be a problem for you. So, if private equity has&nbsp;
become such a bad investment, who keeps on giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.400
them money? What do you do out here in New York&nbsp;
City? I'm in finance. Like, what what exactly? Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.920
private equity. What is the most amount of money&nbsp;
you made in a single year? Half a million. Half&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.720
a million. Companies that are owned by private&nbsp;
equity firms are significantly more likely to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:04.480
go bankrupt. The endless shrimp is not the reason&nbsp;
Red's lobster is in bankruptcy. The fundamental&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.000
problem is the Red Lobster got involved in what's&nbsp;
called private equity. You can't keep doing that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:19.280
You know why? Because the ratio of the debt&nbsp;
of the United States has become unsustainable.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.000
Okay, so a quick refresher on what private&nbsp;
equity is and how it actually works. Private&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.080
equity simply means any investment made into&nbsp;
businesses or assets that are not listed on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.880
public securities markets. Technically, if you&nbsp;
invest a few thousand dollars into a local cafe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.840
you are a private equity investor. Now, what&nbsp;
actually brings all the boys in sleeveless vests&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.080
to the yard are dedicated private equity funds&nbsp;
that raise money from a pool of high-profile&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.440
investors and use that to buy entire businesses,&nbsp;
the so-called buyout funds. These kinds of private&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.520
equity firms will take their investors money, put&nbsp;
in a little bit of their own, and then borrow as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.400
much as they can to fill up a pool of capital that&nbsp;
they can then use to make acquisitions. Once they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.960
buy up a portfolio of real companies producing&nbsp;
real products and generating real cash flows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.920
they get those businesses to take out big loans to&nbsp;
pay money back to them through a special dividend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.920
This means that the founding partners of these&nbsp;
firms can own billions of dollars worth of assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.280
while only having invested a tiny fraction of&nbsp;
their own money. But it doesn't stop there. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.600
private equity company isn't actually responsible&nbsp;
for any of the loans that its portfolio companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:24.080
take out that begins and ends with the companies&nbsp;
themselves. It's like if you own shares in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.880
Walmart, you aren't responsible for the company's&nbsp;
loans if they fail to repay them. The most you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.520
lose is the money you invested if your shares go&nbsp;
to zero. In the case of private equity, what this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.400
lets them do is go back to a bank and show them&nbsp;
a big portfolio of private businesses, which they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.920
can use as security to get you yet another loan.&nbsp;
These are called net asset value loans, but since&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.000
they are loans taken out against companies that&nbsp;
already have loans, they are normally just called&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.160
leverage on leverage or leverage squared, which&nbsp;
does sound familiar. Anyway, the debt doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.800
stop there. Remember that money that the wealthy&nbsp;
investors and private equity partners put in to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.760
get the whole firm started in the first place?&nbsp;
Well, normally even that money is borrowed because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:09.200
investment loans are a very taxefficient way for&nbsp;
wealthy investors to gain exposure to these firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:15.840
But it gets worse. One of the downsides of private&nbsp;
equity is that by definition, it's private, as in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.320
not listed on public markets. That means it can&nbsp;
be difficult for investors to turn their holdings&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.880
in the firm into cash when they need the money.&nbsp;
Fortunately for them, there are firms that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.840
buy stakes in private equity firms from investors&nbsp;
called secondaries funds. Now, regulations&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.800
actually prevent these secondary funds from using&nbsp;
debt to fund their acquisitions. Except of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.080
that's not true at all. Most of their purchases&nbsp;
are indeed also financed with debt. So, if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.320
are keeping track, they will take on debt to buy&nbsp;
a stake in a firm originally purchased with debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:49.280
that was used as a down payment on more debt to&nbsp;
buy a business that took on debt to deliver paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.840
returns to a fund, which used those returns to&nbsp;
qualify for more debt to buy more companies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:59.600
could be used to take on more debt. But anyway,&nbsp;
that's still not everything. So far, this kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.960
of lending has been really profitable, which is&nbsp;
why it's not just banks getting in on the action.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.960
Some private equity firms have specialized in&nbsp;
just lending money to private companies and other&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.600
private equity firms rather than acquiring the&nbsp;
companies themselves. Now, that slide bastard Dan&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.560
Tumi beat me to it again. But these private credit&nbsp;
firms have exploded in scope and scale over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:23.920
last decade, and they now have over $1.6 trillion&nbsp;
in lending within the USA alone, according to data&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.960
from Prequin, a financial research firm. The exact&nbsp;
scale of this lending is hard to know exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.440
because since these private credit firms are not&nbsp;
officially banks and they are lending to private&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.480
companies with no public reporting obligations,&nbsp;
it can be very hard to get reliable data. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.240
you are never going to be able to guess where&nbsp;
these private credit firms get their money to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.520
do this lending. Yeah, that's right. They borrow&nbsp;
it. This endless cycle of leverage on leverage&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.000
on leverage is why private equity has been able&nbsp;
to scale so rapidly and generate so much money&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.720
for the people working in all of these different&nbsp;
organizations. But this money still had to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.920
from somewhere. And statistically, it's come&nbsp;
from you. It's now one of the widely accepted&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.040
rules of investing that it's almost impossible to&nbsp;
beat the returns of the market long-term. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.280
are once in a generation exceptions to this&nbsp;
like Warren Buffett and Jim Simons, but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.920
practically created totally new ways of investing&nbsp;
from scratch. Endless backdated research has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.320
effectively found the same thing. Any investment&nbsp;
managers that have outperformed the market in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.760
past have done so almost entirely because they got&nbsp;
lucky. Funds that get lucky generally outperform&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.400
in the future and tend to underperform over the&nbsp;
following years. This trend can actually be worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.120
than straight up gambling because it's a highly&nbsp;
efficient way to destroy wealth. Now, the infamous&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.920
Kathy Wood generated outstanding returns through&nbsp;
her Arc Innovation Fund by basically going allin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.320
on one of the biggest hype stocks of all time.&nbsp;
In particular, her outstanding performance in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.840
2020 attracted a lot of investors to buy into the&nbsp;
fund right before it lost 70% of its value and has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.600
since delivered weak overall returns. Since its&nbsp;
inception in 2014, the fund has delivered 200%&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:01.520
returns, which is only slightly worse than the&nbsp;
226% the S&amp;P returned over the same time period,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.840
but most ARC investors did not buy in back in&nbsp;
2014. They bought up here at peak hype. So even&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.760
though the fund has performed okay overall, most&nbsp;
investors are holding huge losses. On top of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.280
active investment managers charge fees&nbsp;
for the privilege of managing your money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.760
which further puts them statistically behind over&nbsp;
the long term compared to a passive diversified&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.320
lowcost index fund. The fees charged by private&nbsp;
equity funds are generally some of the highest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.600
in the industry. Sometimes charging clients 5 to&nbsp;
10 times more in fees than even regular actively&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.880
managed funds, which means that in an efficient&nbsp;
market, they would fall even further behind. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.360
the rich people and institutional investors that&nbsp;
give money to private equity managers know this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.520
The research is not new and it's been widely&nbsp;
accepted for decades at this point. So then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.800
who keeps giving private equity so much money?&nbsp;
Well, hot take alert, but the original idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.920
private equity was actually really good. Now,&nbsp;
I know a lot of you are furiously typing in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.640
comments already because yeah, private equity has&nbsp;
turned into an incredibly destructive monolith,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.600
but it didn't start out like this. For investors,&nbsp;
it actually could beat the market because it had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.160
nothing to do with the market. Private equity&nbsp;
didn't deal with listed companies. So, it didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.480
have to compete with all the nerds on Wall Street&nbsp;
that did mathematics PhDs at Penn to ek out three&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.040
basis points of alpha. Instead of trying to&nbsp;
find hidden value in terabytes of market data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.760
private equity instead invested in smaller&nbsp;
local businesses and actively added value by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.320
combining their business acumen with the skills&nbsp;
of the previous owners. A lot of small business&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.640
owners are really good at their craft, but they&nbsp;
lack formal business training, so they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.840
optimize things like marketing, accounting, tax&nbsp;
management, or expansion opportunities. In theory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.840
the management teams from private equity could&nbsp;
find these businesses, make their improvements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.320
and maximize the returns of good, honest&nbsp;
businesses to beat the market consistently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.120
In the early days, this was not a job that finance&nbsp;
bros wanted to be doing because instead of hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.120
out in Manhattan highrises working on glamorous&nbsp;
deals, they would be setting up bookkeeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.520
software for a regional plumbing company in Ohio.&nbsp;
Over time, people noticed that they could make&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.440
a lot of money and charge a lot of fees for this&nbsp;
kind of groundwork, which made it more attractive&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.560
than even top investment banks or hedge funds.&nbsp;
But this has started to change for three reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.640
The first problem is that as the popularity of&nbsp;
private equity has grown, it's become harder to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.280
find businesses worth buying. Back in the early&nbsp;
days when the industry was still in its infancy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.640
small business owners would find it really&nbsp;
difficult to sell their businesses because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.360
not many people have the capital and the expertise&nbsp;
to run something like an HVAC company or mechanic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.840
shop. Because of this, private equity firms&nbsp;
could normally acquire a business for just two&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.080
to three times their annual earnings. Meaning,&nbsp;
even if they didn't make any improvements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.880
they would theoretically be making strong returns&nbsp;
just for maintaining operations. But as more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.360
firms got into the game, the people selling their&nbsp;
businesses had more offers coming in, which meant&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:48.800
new PE firms had to make bigger and bigger bids to&nbsp;
secure acquisitions. According to First Page Sage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.800
a research firm that collects data on this&nbsp;
industry, the average HVAC company now sells&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.480
for a multiple of between 5 and 10 times their&nbsp;
earnings. Now, this data is really hard to collect&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.560
because the details of private equity business&nbsp;
sales don't need to be publicly disclosed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.880
This particular report is just a guesstimation&nbsp;
based on network feedback, expert interviews,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.760
and internal databases. Even based on these rough&nbsp;
numbers, a business that pays 10 years to cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.240
its purchase price is no longer beating the market&nbsp;
after fees and expenses, which means that private&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.240
equity firms had to start pushing their portfolio&nbsp;
companies harder to squeeze out more profit and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.880
then flip them for big capital gains. Now, for&nbsp;
a while, this worked because of a fun little&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.360
trick they could pull in a growing market. After&nbsp;
private equity firms improved the businesses they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.760
acquired, they could sell it for a profit. And&nbsp;
over time, the largest buyer of businesses sold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.400
by private equity firms were other private&nbsp;
equity firms. Because new firms were paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.800
more and more for acquisitions every year, this&nbsp;
made returns look incredibly strong because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.720
were literally pumping their own market. These&nbsp;
strong returns attracted more investment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:51.120
allowed private equity companies to take on more&nbsp;
debt to buy more businesses, driving up prices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.760
which created strong returns for the people who&nbsp;
got in early. This little feedback loop generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.480
incredible returns and made the long-term risks&nbsp;
someone else's problem. So it incentivized the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.440
second problem. Once firms ran out of good stable&nbsp;
businesses with solid cash flows to acquire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.920
they had to look for riskier options to pull the&nbsp;
same trick with. That either meant paying more for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.040
businesses in good stable industries or looking&nbsp;
at questionable businesses in risky industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.000
It didn't really matter because the point was to&nbsp;
flip them to the next buyer. As a random example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.080
there is a good chance that some of your favorite&nbsp;
YouTube channels are now owned by private equity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:29.040
firms. Look, YouTube channels can be great&nbsp;
businesses, but they are just inherently riskier&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:32.640
than something like an established carpentry&nbsp;
company that has been operating for three&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.360
generations. The race to find more businesses&nbsp;
means that risks like these will have become more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.440
common. The other problem with feedback loops&nbsp;
is what happens when they start to go in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.840
other direction. Over the last two decades, the&nbsp;
conditions have been perfect for private equity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.480
to grow. Interest rates have been low. There were&nbsp;
lots of businesses to acquire and people wanted an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.360
alternative to real estate in the stock market.&nbsp;
But that's changing. Baby boomers are aging out&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.000
of their businesses in record numbers, which is&nbsp;
putting more supply back onto the market. Small&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.640
business owners are also more savvy than they&nbsp;
were 20 years ago. Everything you would ever need&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:09.200
to know about running a business effectively is&nbsp;
available online, which means there isn't as much&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.840
opportunity for the private equity Wharton grads&nbsp;
to step in and make big improvements. And finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.240
people are just becoming more skeptical of the&nbsp;
industry. New investments into private equity have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.960
plunged 35% this year because people are realizing&nbsp;
how hard it is to get their cash back out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.760
the system. 2025 is on track to be the lowest&nbsp;
fundraising year for private equity in over a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.800
decade. Unlike public stocks, it's really hard to&nbsp;
tell how much private companies are actually worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.960
until they are sold. What this has done is let&nbsp;
private equity managers sell the businesses that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.120
have performed well and hold on to the businesses&nbsp;
that have not. This makes fund performance look&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.440
really good by realizing potential gains&nbsp;
and hiding unrealized losses. But it also&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.000
means that slowly the portfolio fills up with bad&nbsp;
underperforming businesses and that can only be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.120
kept under wraps for so long. If enough investors&nbsp;
stop investing then private equity will lose their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.360
biggest buyers which are other private equity&nbsp;
firms. Another group that has been doing well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.600
are the secondaries firms. These were the firms&nbsp;
that would buy stakes of private equity investors&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.000
for a discount to give them liquidity when they&nbsp;
needed it. In a surprising twist, some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.920
biggest groups getting out of private equity&nbsp;
right now are colleges with large endowments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.160
Harvard in particular has billions of dollars&nbsp;
invested in private equity and for some reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.480
it needs to raise a little bit of cash right now.&nbsp;
So it's selling its stake to anybody that will buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.720
it. If new investors can buy discounted shares&nbsp;
and buyout firms from panic sellers then there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:29.280
isn't really any reason why they would invest in&nbsp;
a new fund without a discount. Now that actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.760
shouldn't be a problem. The firms could just focus&nbsp;
on improving the businesses in their portfolio and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.720
accept slightly lower returns for a little while.&nbsp;
The only problem is that great big web of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.040
from earlier. A lot of private equity firms need&nbsp;
to keep flipping through businesses to maintain&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.600
repayments to various lenders. And if nobody is&nbsp;
buying, that can turn into a very big problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.400
very quickly. Now, if there is any good news, it's&nbsp;
that there is one niche of private credit that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.200
doing very well. Distressed debt strategies&nbsp;
have had their best year ever with over $21&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.400
billion raised for funds looking to make emergency&nbsp;
loans to businesses going through bankruptcy. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.360
you know, that's a good sign. The bad news is that&nbsp;
if this whole system falls apart, then trillions&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.360
of dollars of bad loans are going to impact&nbsp;
mainstream banks, pension funds, and regular&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.440
people. A lot of this debt was securitized and&nbsp;
turned into traunched bonds, which were then sold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.240
openly with various risk ratings. By layering the&nbsp;
debt, private credit firms could offer low-risk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.720
low return bonds and high-risk, high- return&nbsp;
bonds, all from the same source of debt. By&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.880
design, wealthy investors and the fund managers&nbsp;
use a lot of debt because it means they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.640
actually have to invest that much of their own&nbsp;
money to make big returns when things are doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.360
well. But it also means that they don't stand&nbsp;
to lose much if things fall apart either. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:42.000
fortunately, this is not as big of a structural&nbsp;
issue as mortgage back securities were in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.400
But if a PE slowdown can't be managed carefully,&nbsp;
it could massively disrupt the market for small&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.280
businesses, just like the subprime mortgage crisis&nbsp;
disrupted the market for real estate. But wait,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.200
there's more. The last 2 years, the value of&nbsp;
everything from G-Class Mercedes to Rolex,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.560
Submariners, luxury handbags, and trading cards&nbsp;
has taken a huge hit. Basically, if you saw a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.320
luxury product in a sketchy ad from some guy&nbsp;
trying to sell you a drop shipping course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.800
it's probably hald in value. If you are ever&nbsp;
feeling bad about your own personal financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.160
choices, go and watch finance brokers try to&nbsp;
unwind someone who has $150,000 in negative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.040
equity on an electric that they purchased with&nbsp;
an 8-year loan to rent out on Turo. It should&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.840
make you feel much better. But I am sorry to tell&nbsp;
you that these things might be starting to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:31.600
around for these douchebags. We are re-entering a&nbsp;
market where Bitcoin is breaking all-time records,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.880
stons are only going up and Dogecoin is worth more&nbsp;
than Nintendo, Delta Airlines, or the Ford Motor&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.760
Company. In a market where prices only go up, you&nbsp;
better brace yourself because people are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.000
say that just about anything is an investment&nbsp;
to convince their customers to convince their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.320
partners or just to convince themselves. But that&nbsp;
doesn't matter as long as they can't convince you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.960
That is how I could justify spending $11,000&nbsp;
on a first edition pack of Pokémon cards from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:03.600
Logan Paul. that watches are actually not just&nbsp;
fashion, not just a statement about who you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:10.160
I have been collecting these bags for a minute.&nbsp;
They're also a great investment. Oh, sorry. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.960
owe about 190 left. Yeah. All right. Hummer EV.&nbsp;
Did you see my other Hummer video with the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:20.320
that was like $100,000 upside down? Yeah, that&nbsp;
was Yeah. Yeah. Alternative investments do have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:25.040
a lot of attractive qualities for sophisticated&nbsp;
investors that know how to effectively use them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:29.280
Assets like commercial real estate, patents,&nbsp;
private equity, distressed debt, commodities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.120
and even some collectibles have been purchased&nbsp;
by wealthy people as part of their broader&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.840
investment strategy because they do actually have&nbsp;
a few advantages. The value of these assets are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.360
often uncorrelated to the return of the stock&nbsp;
market, which means that if you are a wealthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.280
individual that loses their job during a market&nbsp;
crash, you won't have to sell your investment&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.600
at record low prices to stay afloat because some&nbsp;
of your alternative investments should still be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.720
doing fine. If you just had investment in equities&nbsp;
and lost your high-paying job in a market crash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:59.040
you might be forced to sell your shares at the&nbsp;
bottom of the market, which as the finance bro say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.480
is not awesome. Some alternative investments also&nbsp;
let their investors have more control over their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:09.600
value. If you own a boring old well- diversified&nbsp;
stock portfolio, there isn't much you can do to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.680
make the whole stock market more valuable. If&nbsp;
you own a piece of commercial real estate or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.040
even something like artwork, you can market it or&nbsp;
do it up, which might help improve its sale price.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.760
Alternative investments also generally have less&nbsp;
competitive markets. If you are trying to find an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.680
edge in the market for stocks or bonds, you are&nbsp;
going up against teams of quantitative analysts&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:32.800
from Jane Street and Citadel Securities who did&nbsp;
a 4-year math program at MIT just to ek out five&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.960
basis points of alpha. You might actually know&nbsp;
something about a niche alternative investment&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.040
that does genuinely give you an edge without&nbsp;
it bordering on insider trading because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:45.680
Securities and Exchange Commission really doesn't&nbsp;
care about what happens in these markets. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:51.920
if you are an industry insider, that could be a&nbsp;
really good thing. But more likely for you, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.200
a really bad thing. So, before you go and rethink&nbsp;
that Masterworks investment, you should also know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:02.320
about the long list of drawbacks with alternative&nbsp;
investments. They are normally highly illiquid&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.160
because the market for them is niche, which&nbsp;
means finding a competitive buyer can sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:11.840
take years. They are also much more expensive to&nbsp;
buy and sell. You can buy stocks on any number&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.880
of commission-free brokerages. And while they do&nbsp;
have some hidden fees, they are barely a rounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.440
air. If you want to sell a piece of artwork,&nbsp;
piece of jewellery, or some other collectible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:26.160
you are probably going to need to go through an&nbsp;
auction house or third party dealer. Sotherby's,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.120
for example, is the most well-known auction house&nbsp;
in the world. And they charge a 20% commission on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:36.400
any sale under $10 million, which is actually&nbsp;
paid by the buyer. Any investment where you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:43.040
automatically 20% down the moment you make your&nbsp;
purchase is going to be risky at best. But let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:47.840
be honest, most of you watching aren't seriously&nbsp;
considering a multi-million dollar artwork to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.160
round out your investment strategy. And if you&nbsp;
are seriously considering a syndicated artwork&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.960
investment system, then I have really failed&nbsp;
to teach you how money works. The alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.520
investments that have really been generating all&nbsp;
the attention are manufactured luxury goods that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.560
can't keep up with demand or intentionally limit&nbsp;
production to create a sense of exclusivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:11.280
High-end luxury watches from brands like PC,&nbsp;
Philippe, and Rolex. Limited run cars, as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.760
as certain designer shoes and handbags, all have&nbsp;
long wait lists from authorized dealers that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:20.560
stretch for years before you're even allowed to&nbsp;
drop 5 figures on a fashion accessory. This has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.880
created a huge gray market for these items where&nbsp;
people can wait to buy a bag or a watch from these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:30.080
stores and then sell them for a premium to a buyer&nbsp;
who just wants their new toy right now. Something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:34.480
that you can buy one day and then instantly sell&nbsp;
the next day for a huge premium sounds like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:40.400
most risk-free investment there is. And it would&nbsp;
be if it actually worked like that. People have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.480
seen the opportunity to make some easy money and&nbsp;
have ran with it so hard that there are even sites&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.680
that collate sales data to make trackable indexes&nbsp;
which as you can see have not been telling a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.640
story about the actual performance of these&nbsp;
investments. It might be unsurprising to you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:59.280
but the hype around these markets is also highly&nbsp;
correlated with the hype around other alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:03.920
investments like cryptocurrencies. And with the&nbsp;
current massive rally in dog themed financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.560
instruments and other such nonsense, we got to&nbsp;
talk about it before anybody else does something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:13.760
stupid. There is of course another reason why&nbsp;
people are attracted to highly speculative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.720
alternative investments and that's simply their&nbsp;
potential to be a lottery ticket out of poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.600
A well- diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds,&nbsp;
and real estate is an incredibly powerful tool&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:28.320
to build wealth. But if you don't have any wealth&nbsp;
to begin with, even Warren Buffett level returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.560
won't make you wealthy within your lifetime unless&nbsp;
you can make consistent contributions towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.680
those investments. Cryptocurrencies, meme stocks,&nbsp;
trading cards, and even straightup gambling is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.800
giving hope to a lot of people. Even if for most&nbsp;
of them, it will only make their problems worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.600
But for the lucky few who did time their purchases&nbsp;
correctly, they have turned incidental amounts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.520
money into very substantial positions. The&nbsp;
people that have sold out of these positions&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.240
have a higher propensity to consume, especially&nbsp;
on luxury goods to show off their new fortunes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:02.640
which was in part why the aftermarket for luxury&nbsp;
goods saw such a boom from 2020 to 2022. The trend&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.200
was so strong that these items were seen as&nbsp;
investments themselves. The brands themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.200
although they would never publicly admit it,&nbsp;
heavily played into this idea of scarcity by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:15.200
limiting their production of popular products and&nbsp;
raising prices above the rate of inflation year&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:20.240
after year to make it seem like it was a privilege&nbsp;
to pay the price of a family SUV for a watch. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.000
the end of the day, these are companies with a&nbsp;
profit motive, and the only reason they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.120
limit production is because it would increase the&nbsp;
premium they could charge. Paying $50,000 for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:34.000
watch seems stupid. But if someone that just made&nbsp;
a fortune on a monkey JPEG is willing to buy it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.920
off you for $100,000, then it's just responsible&nbsp;
investing. But what is particularly interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:45.760
is why this isn't happening again this time.&nbsp;
The price of highly risky investments is up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.880
but the price of all the junk that people normally&nbsp;
buy when their doggy coin moons has stayed down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:56.480
So what gives? The logical answer is that sports&nbsp;
betting and meme-coin speculators have suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:01.120
become very fiscally responsible. And instead of&nbsp;
blowing their profits on babbling goods to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.880
off their newfound wealth, they are prudently&nbsp;
investing it into a structured portfolio to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:10.240
provide them with a stable return. Yeah. Okay. So,&nbsp;
there are actually three things that have happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.040
here. These dumb expensive trinkets that people&nbsp;
insisted were great investments are actually an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:20.160
indication of a much bigger shift in the economy&nbsp;
and habits of retail investors. The first big&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.560
change is that these markets, which used to be&nbsp;
made up of small-time unsophisticated investors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.360
have become just as consolidated, if not more&nbsp;
consolidated than traditional equities markets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.360
with the largest, wealthiest investors controlling&nbsp;
a huge share of the total supply of things like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.720
cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin going from 20K to&nbsp;
90K in a year will make people a lot of money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.960
but it's going mainly to the type of people that&nbsp;
already had a lot of money to put into a risky&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.480
investment. It's a huge return, but to someone who&nbsp;
only had $1,000 to invest, it's not going to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.360
them life-changing amounts of money like it would&nbsp;
have if they invested early in the 2010s. If the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.680
Winklvoss twins make an extra billion dollars on&nbsp;
the appreciation of Bitcoin, they are not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.720
to wear 100,000 PC Philippes. Which means even&nbsp;
though the net wealth creation might be the same,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.200
the resulting propensity to consume is much lower&nbsp;
when the rewards are going to people who could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.640
have already purchased any luxury good they ever&nbsp;
wanted. For many of the small investors who want a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.800
chance to make life-changing amounts of money from&nbsp;
their limited capital, the boat has already sailed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.360
on Bitcoin. Which is why people keep falling for&nbsp;
rugpull after rugpull on the promise that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.480
time will be different because they simply need&nbsp;
the chance. The reason that people are making&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.600
these gambles is also different. A Wall Street&nbsp;
Journal survey of investors with low FICO scores&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.240
found that their primary reason for investing&nbsp;
was not to build wealth, but to pay off debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.640
Credit card debt is now approaching all-time highs&nbsp;
and interest rates on all kinds of borrowing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:45.760
up. So even when people are lucky enough to turn&nbsp;
a profit on these extremely risky investments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.720
they are just going back to square one,&nbsp;
not actually getting ahead. Four years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.720
dumb investments were turning people's stimulus&nbsp;
checks into enough money for a down payment on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:00.240
a Lamborghini Urus. Today, they are lucky if it&nbsp;
pays off their heavily underwater car loan. People&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.600
are no longer being greedy. They are just being&nbsp;
desperate. Now, you have probably experienced this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.080
cultural shift from the pandemic era exuberance&nbsp;
to the more cautious financial environment today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:15.520
Even though most macroeconomic indicators are up&nbsp;
and to the right, but these investments are also&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.600
getting hurt by a market where none of you are&nbsp;
watching from, which hasn't even been able to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.480
its broad economic indicators look good. China has&nbsp;
become the largest market in the world for luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.080
goods because the country has produced a lot&nbsp;
of wealthy people very quickly and those people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.800
are eager to show off their newfound fortunes&nbsp;
with luxury goods. Unfortunately, real estate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.280
the primary wealth generator in China and the&nbsp;
single largest asset market in the entire world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.360
has been floundering since Evergrand and other&nbsp;
major property developers started failing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.920
flooding the market with more apartments at fire&nbsp;
sale prices. This wealth destruction along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.920
the strong push by the government to crack down&nbsp;
on extravagant displays of wealth has meant demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.160
for luxury goods in the country has fallen at the&nbsp;
same time as luxury good companies have expended&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:58.880
to keep up with demand that has disappeared. It&nbsp;
should go without saying, but even really smart&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.960
people can do stupid things with their money if&nbsp;
they want something to be true. A lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:07.200
want to convince themselves that their new luxury&nbsp;
purchase is not only a nice toy, but a prudent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:12.240
investment when it simply isn't. Even if there&nbsp;
is a premium between retail price and what it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.640
could be sold for in the gray market, you normally&nbsp;
have to spend a lot of money at authorized dealers&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.960
before you're allowed to get to the front of the&nbsp;
weight list. After that, the risk adjusted returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.240
are probably very bad, if not non-existent.&nbsp;
If you want to invest your money, invest your&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.800
money. If you want to buy something nice to treat&nbsp;
yourself by buying something nice, treat yourself.
