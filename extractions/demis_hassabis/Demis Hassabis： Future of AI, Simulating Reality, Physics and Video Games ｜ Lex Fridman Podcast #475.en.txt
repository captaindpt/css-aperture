force a solution find the best move and
go or find the the exact shape of a
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
go or find the the exact shape of a
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.229 align:start position:0%
go or find the the exact shape of a
protein and if you enumerated all the
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
protein and if you enumerated all the
00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.830 align:start position:0%
protein and if you enumerated all the
possibilities you there wouldn't be
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
possibilities you there wouldn't be
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
possibilities you there wouldn't be
enough time in the in the you know the
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
enough time in the in the you know the
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.509 align:start position:0%
enough time in the in the you know the
time of the universe. So you have to do
00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 align:start position:0%
time of the universe. So you have to do
00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.190 align:start position:0%
time of the universe. So you have to do
something much smarter and what we did
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
something much smarter and what we did
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
something much smarter and what we did
in both cases was build models of those
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
in both cases was build models of those
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.630 align:start position:0%
in both cases was build models of those
environments. Um and that guided the
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
environments. Um and that guided the
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.869 align:start position:0%
environments. Um and that guided the
search in a in a smart way and that
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 align:start position:0%
search in a in a smart way and that
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.030 align:start position:0%
search in a in a smart way and that
makes it tractable. So if you think
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
makes it tractable. So if you think
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.710 align:start position:0%
makes it tractable. So if you think
about protein folding which is obviously
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
about protein folding which is obviously
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.550 align:start position:0%
about protein folding which is obviously
a natural system you know why should
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
a natural system you know why should
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.470 align:start position:0%
a natural system you know why should
that be possible? How does physics do
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
that be possible? How does physics do
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.830 align:start position:0%
that be possible? How does physics do
that? You know proteins fold in
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
that? You know proteins fold in
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.070 align:start position:0%
that? You know proteins fold in
milliseconds in our bodies. So somehow
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
milliseconds in our bodies. So somehow
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.229 align:start position:0%
milliseconds in our bodies. So somehow
physics solves this problem that we've
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
physics solves this problem that we've
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.949 align:start position:0%
physics solves this problem that we've
now also solved computationally. And I
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 align:start position:0%
now also solved computationally. And I
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.869 align:start position:0%
now also solved computationally. And I
think the reason that's possible is that
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
think the reason that's possible is that
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.350 align:start position:0%
think the reason that's possible is that
in nature, natural systems have
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
in nature, natural systems have
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.589 align:start position:0%
in nature, natural systems have
structure because they were subject to
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
structure because they were subject to
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.309 align:start position:0%
structure because they were subject to
evolutionary processes that that shape
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
evolutionary processes that that shape
00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
evolutionary processes that that shape
them. And if that's true, then you can
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
them. And if that's true, then you can
00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.949 align:start position:0%
them. And if that's true, then you can
maybe learn uh uh what that structure
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
maybe learn uh uh what that structure
00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.190 align:start position:0%
maybe learn uh uh what that structure
is. So this perspective, I think, is
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
is. So this perspective, I think, is
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.670 align:start position:0%
is. So this perspective, I think, is
really interesting one. You've hinted it
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
really interesting one. You've hinted it
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.710 align:start position:0%
really interesting one. You've hinted it
at it, which is almost like uh crudely
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
at it, which is almost like uh crudely
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.149 align:start position:0%
at it, which is almost like uh crudely
stated. Anything that can be evolved can
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
stated. Anything that can be evolved can
00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.149 align:start position:0%
stated. Anything that can be evolved can
be efficiently modeled. Think there's
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
be efficiently modeled. Think there's
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.830 align:start position:0%
be efficiently modeled. Think there's
some truth to that. Yeah, I sometimes
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
some truth to that. Yeah, I sometimes
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.750 align:start position:0%
some truth to that. Yeah, I sometimes
call it survival of the stablest or
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
call it survival of the stablest or
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
call it survival of the stablest or
something like that because you know
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
something like that because you know
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.270 align:start position:0%
something like that because you know
it's it's of course there's evolution
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's of course there's evolution
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
it's it's of course there's evolution
for life uh living things but there's
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
for life uh living things but there's
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.670 align:start position:0%
for life uh living things but there's
also you know if you think about
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
also you know if you think about
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.830 align:start position:0%
also you know if you think about
geological time so the shape of
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
geological time so the shape of
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.909 align:start position:0%
geological time so the shape of
mountains that's been shaped by
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
mountains that's been shaped by
00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
mountains that's been shaped by
weathering processes right over
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
weathering processes right over
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.509 align:start position:0%
weathering processes right over
thousands of years but then you can even
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
thousands of years but then you can even
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.270 align:start position:0%
thousands of years but then you can even
take it cosmological the orbits of
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
take it cosmological the orbits of
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.070 align:start position:0%
take it cosmological the orbits of
planets the um shapes of asteroids these
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
planets the um shapes of asteroids these
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.710 align:start position:0%
planets the um shapes of asteroids these
have all been survived kind of processes
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
have all been survived kind of processes
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.030 align:start position:0%
have all been survived kind of processes
that have acted on them many many times
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
that have acted on them many many times
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.030 align:start position:0%
that have acted on them many many times
so if that's true then there should some
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
so if that's true then there should some
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.749 align:start position:0%
so if that's true then there should some
sort of pattern um that you can kind of
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
sort of pattern um that you can kind of
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
sort of pattern um that you can kind of
reverse learn and uh a kind of manifold
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
reverse learn and uh a kind of manifold
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
reverse learn and uh a kind of manifold
really that helps you uh uh search to
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
really that helps you uh uh search to
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.909 align:start position:0%
really that helps you uh uh search to
the right solution to the right shape um
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
the right solution to the right shape um
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.430 align:start position:0%
the right solution to the right shape um
and actually allow you to predict things
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
and actually allow you to predict things
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.670 align:start position:0%
and actually allow you to predict things
about it uh in an efficient way because
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
about it uh in an efficient way because
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
about it uh in an efficient way because
it's not a random pattern right so um it
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a random pattern right so um it
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.150 align:start position:0%
it's not a random pattern right so um it
may not be possible for for man-made
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
may not be possible for for man-made
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.430 align:start position:0%
may not be possible for for man-made
things or abstract things like
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
things or abstract things like
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.830 align:start position:0%

factorizing large numbers because unless
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
factorizing large numbers because unless
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.189 align:start position:0%
factorizing large numbers because unless
there's patterns in the number space
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
there's patterns in the number space
00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
there's patterns in the number space
which there might be but if there's not
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
which there might be but if there's not
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.870 align:start position:0%
which there might be but if there's not
and it's uniform then there's no pattern
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
and it's uniform then there's no pattern
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.870 align:start position:0%
and it's uniform then there's no pattern
to learn there's no model to learn that
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
to learn there's no model to learn that
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.390 align:start position:0%
to learn there's no model to learn that
will help you search. So you have to do
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
will help you search. So you have to do
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.310 align:start position:0%
will help you search. So you have to do
brute force. So in that case you you
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
brute force. So in that case you you
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.909 align:start position:0%
brute force. So in that case you you
know you maybe need a quantum computer
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
know you maybe need a quantum computer
00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.510 align:start position:0%
know you maybe need a quantum computer
something like this. But in most things
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
something like this. But in most things
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
something like this. But in most things
in nature that we're interested in uh
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
in nature that we're interested in uh
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
in nature that we're interested in uh
are not like that. They have structure
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
are not like that. They have structure
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
are not like that. They have structure
um that evolved for a reason and
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
um that evolved for a reason and
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.790 align:start position:0%
um that evolved for a reason and
survived over time. And if that's true I
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
survived over time. And if that's true I
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
survived over time. And if that's true I
think that's potentially learnable by a
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
think that's potentially learnable by a
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.510 align:start position:0%
think that's potentially learnable by a
neural network.
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
neural network.
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
neural network.
&gt;&gt; It's like nature is doing a search
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It's like nature is doing a search
00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.390 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It's like nature is doing a search
process and it's so fascinating that
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
process and it's so fascinating that
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.110 align:start position:0%
process and it's so fascinating that
it's in that search process is creating
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's in that search process is creating
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.550 align:start position:0%
it's in that search process is creating
systems that could be efficiently
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
systems that could be efficiently
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.950 align:start position:0%
systems that could be efficiently
modeled. That's right. Yeah.
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
modeled. That's right. Yeah.
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.749 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; So interesting.
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So interesting.
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.749 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So interesting.
&gt;&gt; So they can be efficiently rediscovered
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So they can be efficiently rediscovered
00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.070 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So they can be efficiently rediscovered
or recovered um because nature is not
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
or recovered um because nature is not
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.909 align:start position:0%
or recovered um because nature is not
random, right? These everything that we

elements that are more stable, all of
00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
elements that are more stable, all of
those things, they're subject to um some

those things, they're subject to um some
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.909 align:start position:0%
those things, they're subject to um some

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
mapped on to these natural systems so
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.150 align:start position:0%
mapped on to these natural systems so
you know the things that exist in
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know the things that exist in
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
you know the things that exist in

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.029 align:start position:0%

and have structure. So I think that
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
and have structure. So I think that
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.110 align:start position:0%
and have structure. So I think that
could be a very interesting uh new way
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
could be a very interesting uh new way
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.790 align:start position:0%
could be a very interesting uh new way
of thinking about it. And it sort of
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
of thinking about it. And it sort of
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.230 align:start position:0%
of thinking about it. And it sort of
fits with the way I think about physics
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
fits with the way I think about physics
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.909 align:start position:0%
fits with the way I think about physics
in general which is that you know I
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%

think information is primary.
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
think information is primary.
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.710 align:start position:0%
think information is primary.
Information is the most sort of
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
Information is the most sort of
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.629 align:start position:0%
Information is the most sort of
fundamental unit of the universe more
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
fundamental unit of the universe more
00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
fundamental unit of the universe more
fundamental than energy and matter. I
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
fundamental than energy and matter. I
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.670 align:start position:0%
fundamental than energy and matter. I
think they can all be converted into
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
think they can all be converted into
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.670 align:start position:0%
think they can all be converted into
each other but I think of the universe
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
each other but I think of the universe
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.430 align:start position:0%
each other but I think of the universe
as a kind of informationational system.
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
as a kind of informationational system.
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.110 align:start position:0%
as a kind of informationational system.
&gt;&gt; So when you think of the universe as
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So when you think of the universe as
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.909 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So when you think of the universe as
anformational system then the P= NP
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
anformational system then the P= NP
00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.629 align:start position:0%
anformational system then the P= NP

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
question is a is a physics question.
00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.710 align:start position:0%
question is a is a physics question.
&gt;&gt; That's right. And it's a question that
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; That's right. And it's a question that
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.189 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; That's right. And it's a question that
can help us actually solve the entirety
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
can help us actually solve the entirety
00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
can help us actually solve the entirety
of this whole thing going on.
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
of this whole thing going on.
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.150 align:start position:0%
of this whole thing going on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's one of the most uh
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's one of the most uh
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's one of the most uh
fundamental questions actually if you
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental questions actually if you
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.230 align:start position:0%
fundamental questions actually if you
think of physics asformational
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
think of physics asformational
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
think of physics asformational
uh and and the answer to that I think is
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh and and the answer to that I think is
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.990 align:start position:0%
uh and and the answer to that I think is
going to be you know very enlightening.
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to be you know very enlightening.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.749 align:start position:0%

do a forward simulation of it and it
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
do a forward simulation of it and it
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.670 align:start position:0%
do a forward simulation of it and it
probably be efficient enough. Um, of
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
probably be efficient enough. Um, of
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
probably be efficient enough. Um, of
course there's the question of things
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
course there's the question of things
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
course there's the question of things
like chaotic systems where the initial

like chaotic systems where the initial
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.910 align:start position:0%

get to some, you know, uncorrelated end
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
questions. But I think when you step
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.870 align:start position:0%
questions. But I think when you step
back and look at what we've done with
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
back and look at what we've done with
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.230 align:start position:0%

the systems and the and the problems
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.069 align:start position:0%

that we've solved and then you look at
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
that we've solved and then you look at
00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%

it's pretty interesting. I think it's
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's pretty interesting. I think it's
telling us something quite fundamental
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.150 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yes and it's very interesting you know
even if we if you were to ask me 5 10

even if we if you were to ask me 5 10
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.909 align:start position:0%
even if we if you were to ask me 5 10
years ago I would have said even though

I was immersed in all of this I would
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
I was immersed in all of this I would
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.870 align:start position:0%
I was immersed in all of this I would
have said well yeah you probably need to
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
have said well yeah you probably need to
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.710 align:start position:0%
have said well yeah you probably need to
understand intuitive physics you know
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
understand intuitive physics you know
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
understand intuitive physics you know
like if I push this off the table this
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%

glass it will maybe shatter you know um
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
glass it will maybe shatter you know um
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
glass it will maybe shatter you know um
and and the liquid will spill out right
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
and and the liquid will spill out right
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.510 align:start position:0%

so we know all of these things but I
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we know all of these things but I
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.029 align:start position:0%
so we know all of these things but I
thought that you know and there's a lot
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
thought that you know and there's a lot
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:50.630 align:start position:0%

you need to act in the world to really

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.549 align:start position:0%

there was a lot of theories about you
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of theories about you
00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:00.390 align:start position:0%

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.549 align:start position:0%

action uh so that you would understand
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
action uh so that you would understand
things like intuitive physics. But it
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
things like intuitive physics. But it
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.110 align:start position:0%
things like intuitive physics. But it
seems like um you can understand it
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
seems like um you can understand it
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.029 align:start position:0%

through passive observation which is
00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.190 align:start position:0%

pretty surprising to me and and again I
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.190 align:start position:0%

think hints at something underlying
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
think hints at something underlying
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.230 align:start position:0%

about the nature of uh reality in in my

about the nature of uh reality in in my

about the nature of uh reality in in my

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
cool videos that it generates. Um and
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.029 align:start position:0%
cool videos that it generates. Um and
and of course there's next stages is
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
and of course there's next stages is
00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.390 align:start position:0%
and of course there's next stages is
maybe even making those videos
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
maybe even making those videos
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.350 align:start position:0%

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.669 align:start position:0%

would be really mind-blowing especially
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
would be really mind-blowing especially
00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.990 align:start position:0%

'90s if I'd had access to the kind of AI
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
'90s if I'd had access to the kind of AI
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.950 align:start position:0%
'90s if I'd had access to the kind of AI
systems we have today? And I think you
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
systems we have today? And I think you
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.710 align:start position:0%
systems we have today? And I think you
could build absolutely mind-blowing
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
could build absolutely mind-blowing
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
could build absolutely mind-blowing
games. Um, and I think the next stage is
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
games. Um, and I think the next stage is
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.470 align:start position:0%
games. Um, and I think the next stage is
I always used to love making all the
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
I always used to love making all the
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.950 align:start position:0%
I always used to love making all the
games I've made are openw world games.
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
games I've made are openw world games.
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.150 align:start position:0%
games I've made are openw world games.
So, they're games where there's a
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
So, they're games where there's a
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.470 align:start position:0%
So, they're games where there's a
simulation and then there's AI
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
simulation and then there's AI
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.190 align:start position:0%
simulation and then there's AI
characters and then the player uh
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
characters and then the player uh
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.029 align:start position:0%
characters and then the player uh
interacts with that simulation and the
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
interacts with that simulation and the
00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
interacts with that simulation and the
simulation adapts to the way the player
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
simulation adapts to the way the player
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
simulation adapts to the way the player
plays. And I always thought they were
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
plays. And I always thought they were
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.710 align:start position:0%
plays. And I always thought they were
the coolest games because uh so games
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
the coolest games because uh so games
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.549 align:start position:0%
the coolest games because uh so games
like theme park that I worked on where
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
like theme park that I worked on where
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
like theme park that I worked on where
everybody's game experience would be
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's game experience would be
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.909 align:start position:0%
everybody's game experience would be
unique to them, right? Because you're
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
unique to them, right? Because you're
00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.390 align:start position:0%
unique to them, right? Because you're
kind of co-creating the game, right? Uh
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
kind of co-creating the game, right? Uh
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
kind of co-creating the game, right? Uh
we set up the parameters, we set up
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
we set up the parameters, we set up
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
we set up the parameters, we set up
initial conditions, and then you as the
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
initial conditions, and then you as the
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.149 align:start position:0%
initial conditions, and then you as the
player immersed in it, and then you are
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
player immersed in it, and then you are
00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
player immersed in it, and then you are
co-creating it with the with the
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
co-creating it with the with the
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.909 align:start position:0%
co-creating it with the with the
simulation. But of course, it's very
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
simulation. But of course, it's very
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:33.990 align:start position:0%
simulation. But of course, it's very
hard to program open world games. you
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
hard to program open world games. you
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.590 align:start position:0%
hard to program open world games. you
know, you've got to be able to create uh
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
know, you've got to be able to create uh
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.190 align:start position:0%
know, you've got to be able to create uh
content whichever direction the player
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
content whichever direction the player
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.029 align:start position:0%
content whichever direction the player
goes in and you want it to be compelling
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
goes in and you want it to be compelling
00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:41.750 align:start position:0%
goes in and you want it to be compelling
no matter what the player chooses. Um,
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
no matter what the player chooses. Um,
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.909 align:start position:0%
no matter what the player chooses. Um,
and so it was always quite difficult to
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
and so it was always quite difficult to
00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:46.070 align:start position:0%
and so it was always quite difficult to
build uh things like cellular automter
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
build uh things like cellular automter
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
build uh things like cellular automter
actually type of those kind of classical

systems which created some emergent

systems which created some emergent

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
behavior. Um, but they're always a
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.990 align:start position:0%

little bit fragile, a little bit
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
little bit fragile, a little bit
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.390 align:start position:0%
little bit fragile, a little bit
limited. Now we're maybe on the cusp in
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
limited. Now we're maybe on the cusp in
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
limited. Now we're maybe on the cusp in
the next few years, 5 10 years of having
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
the next few years, 5 10 years of having
00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:58.789 align:start position:0%

AI systems that can truly create around
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
AI systems that can truly create around
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.669 align:start position:0%
AI systems that can truly create around
your imagination. um can nar sort of
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
your imagination. um can nar sort of
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.510 align:start position:0%
your imagination. um can nar sort of
dynamically change the story and
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
dynamically change the story and
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
dynamically change the story and
storytell the narrative around uh and
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
storytell the narrative around uh and
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.390 align:start position:0%
storytell the narrative around uh and
make it dramatic no matter what you end
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
make it dramatic no matter what you end
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.149 align:start position:0%
make it dramatic no matter what you end
up choosing. So it's like the ultimate
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
up choosing. So it's like the ultimate
00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:12.630 align:start position:0%
up choosing. So it's like the ultimate
choose your own adventure sort of game.
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
choose your own adventure sort of game.
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.710 align:start position:0%
choose your own adventure sort of game.
And uh you know I think maybe we're
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
And uh you know I think maybe we're
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.310 align:start position:0%
And uh you know I think maybe we're
within reach if you think of a kind of
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
within reach if you think of a kind of
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.430 align:start position:0%
within reach if you think of a kind of
interactive version of VO uh and then
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
interactive version of VO uh and then
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.990 align:start position:0%
interactive version of VO uh and then
wind that forward 5 to 10 years and you
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
wind that forward 5 to 10 years and you
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
wind that forward 5 to 10 years and you
know imagine how good it's going to be.
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
know imagine how good it's going to be.
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.590 align:start position:0%
know imagine how good it's going to be.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you said a lot of super
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you said a lot of super
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you said a lot of super
interesting stuff there. So one the open
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
interesting stuff there. So one the open
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.430 align:start position:0%
interesting stuff there. So one the open
world
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
world
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.029 align:start position:0%
world
built into that is a deep
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
built into that is a deep
00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:32.950 align:start position:0%

personalization the way you've described
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
personalization the way you've described
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.430 align:start position:0%
personalization the way you've described
it.
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
it.
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.270 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; So it's not just that it's open world
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So it's not just that it's open world
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.190 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So it's not just that it's open world
like you can open any door and there'll
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
like you can open any door and there'll
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.590 align:start position:0%
like you can open any door and there'll
be something there. It's that the choice
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
be something there. It's that the choice
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.750 align:start position:0%
be something there. It's that the choice
of which door you open
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
of which door you open
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.390 align:start position:0%
of which door you open
&gt;&gt; in an unconstrained way defines the
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; in an unconstrained way defines the
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.110 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; in an unconstrained way defines the
worlds you see. So some games try to do
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
worlds you see. So some games try to do
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.669 align:start position:0%
worlds you see. So some games try to do
that to give you choice. Yes. But it's
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
that to give you choice. Yes. But it's
00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
that to give you choice. Yes. But it's
really just an illusion of choice
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
really just an illusion of choice
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
really just an illusion of choice
because
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
because
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.669 align:start position:0%
because
&gt;&gt; the only uh like like Stanley Parable

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.430 align:start position:0%

really there's a couple of doors and it
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
really there's a couple of doors and it
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.270 align:start position:0%
really there's a couple of doors and it
really just takes you down a narrative.
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
really just takes you down a narrative.
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.029 align:start position:0%
really just takes you down a narrative.
Stanley Parable is a great video game I
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
Stanley Parable is a great video game I
00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:05.350 align:start position:0%
Stanley Parable is a great video game I
recommend people play that kind of uh in
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
recommend people play that kind of uh in
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.669 align:start position:0%
recommend people play that kind of uh in
a meta way uh mocks the illusion of
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
a meta way uh mocks the illusion of
00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:11.190 align:start position:0%
a meta way uh mocks the illusion of
choice and there's philosophical notions
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
choice and there's philosophical notions
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
choice and there's philosophical notions
of free will and so on. But uh I do like
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
of free will and so on. But uh I do like
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
of free will and so on. But uh I do like
one of my favorite games of Elder

one of my favorite games of Elder

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
Scrolls is Daggerfall. I believe that
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.789 align:start position:0%
Scrolls is Daggerfall. I believe that
they really played with a like random
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
they really played with a like random
00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.549 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Of you can step in and they give you

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.230 align:start position:0%

this feeling of an open world and there
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
this feeling of an open world and there
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.549 align:start position:0%
this feeling of an open world and there
you mentioned interactivity. You don't
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
you mentioned interactivity. You don't
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
you mentioned interactivity. You don't
need to interact. That's a first step
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
need to interact. That's a first step
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
need to interact. That's a first step
cuz you don't need to interact that
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
cuz you don't need to interact that
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.909 align:start position:0%
cuz you don't need to interact that
much. You just when you open the door,
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
much. You just when you open the door,
00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:40.630 align:start position:0%
much. You just when you open the door,
whatever you see is randomly generated
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
whatever you see is randomly generated
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.110 align:start position:0%
whatever you see is randomly generated
for you.
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
for you.
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.870 align:start position:0%
for you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's already an incredible
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's already an incredible
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.470 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's already an incredible
experience because you might be the only
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
experience because you might be the only
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
experience because you might be the only
person to ever see that.
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
person to ever see that.
00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:49.190 align:start position:0%
person to ever see that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. And and so but what you'd
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. And and so but what you'd
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.789 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. And and so but what you'd
like is a little bit better than just
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
like is a little bit better than just
00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.870 align:start position:0%
like is a little bit better than just
sort of a random generation, right? So
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a random generation, right? So
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
sort of a random generation, right? So
you'd like uh and and also better than a
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
you'd like uh and and also better than a
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.149 align:start position:0%
you'd like uh and and also better than a
simple AB hardcoded choice, right?
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
simple AB hardcoded choice, right?
00:22:58.159 --> 00:23:01.270 align:start position:0%
simple AB hardcoded choice, right?
That's not really uh open world, right?
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
That's not really uh open world, right?
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.549 align:start position:0%
That's not really uh open world, right?
As you say, it's just giving you the
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
As you say, it's just giving you the
00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:03.909 align:start position:0%
As you say, it's just giving you the
illusion of choice. What you want to be
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
illusion of choice. What you want to be
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.669 align:start position:0%
illusion of choice. What you want to be
able to do is is potentially anything in
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
able to do is is potentially anything in
00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:09.270 align:start position:0%
able to do is is potentially anything in
that game environment. Um, and I think
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
that game environment. Um, and I think
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
that game environment. Um, and I think
the only way you can do that is to have
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
the only way you can do that is to have
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.149 align:start position:0%
the only way you can do that is to have
uh generated systems, systems that uh
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh generated systems, systems that uh
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.510 align:start position:0%
uh generated systems, systems that uh
will generate that on the fly. Of
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
will generate that on the fly. Of
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.110 align:start position:0%
will generate that on the fly. Of
course, you can't create infinite
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
course, you can't create infinite
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.710 align:start position:0%
course, you can't create infinite
amounts of game assets, right? It's
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
amounts of game assets, right? It's
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.870 align:start position:0%
amounts of game assets, right? It's
expensive enough already how AAA games
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
expensive enough already how AAA games
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.870 align:start position:0%
expensive enough already how AAA games
are made today. And that was obvious to
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
are made today. And that was obvious to
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.029 align:start position:0%
are made today. And that was obvious to
to us back in the '9s when I was working
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
to us back in the '9s when I was working
00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:26.950 align:start position:0%
to us back in the '9s when I was working
on all these games. I think maybe Black
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
on all these games. I think maybe Black
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
on all these games. I think maybe Black
and White uh was the game that I worked
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
and White uh was the game that I worked
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.430 align:start position:0%
and White uh was the game that I worked
on, early stages of that that had the
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
on, early stages of that that had the
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
on, early stages of that that had the
still probably the best AI learning AI
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
still probably the best AI learning AI
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.950 align:start position:0%
still probably the best AI learning AI
in it. It was an early reinforcement
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
in it. It was an early reinforcement
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.510 align:start position:0%
in it. It was an early reinforcement
learning system that you, you know, you
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
learning system that you, you know, you
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.710 align:start position:0%
learning system that you, you know, you
were, you were looking after this
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
were, you were looking after this
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.630 align:start position:0%
were, you were looking after this
mythical creature and growing it and
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
mythical creature and growing it and
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.230 align:start position:0%
mythical creature and growing it and
nurturing it and depending how you
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
nurturing it and depending how you
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.390 align:start position:0%
nurturing it and depending how you
treated it, it would treat the villagers
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
treated it, it would treat the villagers
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.909 align:start position:0%
treated it, it would treat the villagers
in that world in the same way. So if you
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
in that world in the same way. So if you
00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:47.430 align:start position:0%
in that world in the same way. So if you
were mean to it, it would be mean. If
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
were mean to it, it would be mean. If
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.190 align:start position:0%
were mean to it, it would be mean. If
you were good, it would be protective.
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
you were good, it would be protective.
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.270 align:start position:0%
you were good, it would be protective.
And so it was really a reflection of the
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
And so it was really a reflection of the
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
And so it was really a reflection of the
way you played it. So actually all of
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
way you played it. So actually all of
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.029 align:start position:0%
way you played it. So actually all of
the uh I've been working on sort of
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
the uh I've been working on sort of
00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:58.070 align:start position:0%

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.070 align:start position:0%

and really the whole of what I do today
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
and really the whole of what I do today
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
and really the whole of what I do today
is still a follow on from uh those early
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
is still a follow on from uh those early
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.430 align:start position:0%
is still a follow on from uh those early

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been uh interesting,

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been uh interesting,

&gt;&gt; That you might not have time to really
create a game. You might end up creating

&gt;&gt; other others create the thing you've
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.110 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; other others create the thing you've
always dreamed of. Do you think it's
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
always dreamed of. Do you think it's
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.549 align:start position:0%
always dreamed of. Do you think it's
possible you can somehow in your

time to create something like black and
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.149 align:start position:0%
time to create something like black and
white? some some an actual video game

where like you could make the childhood
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.830 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; You know, there's two things way to
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; You know, there's two things way to
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; You know, there's two things way to
think about that is maybe with vibe
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
think about that is maybe with vibe
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.390 align:start position:0%
think about that is maybe with vibe
coding as it gets better and there's a
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
coding as it gets better and there's a
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
coding as it gets better and there's a
possibility that I could, you know, one
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
possibility that I could, you know, one
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
possibility that I could, you know, one
could do that actually in in your spare
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
could do that actually in in your spare
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
could do that actually in in your spare
time. So, I'm quite excited about that
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
time. So, I'm quite excited about that
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
time. So, I'm quite excited about that
as a as that would be my project if if I
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
as a as that would be my project if if I
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.390 align:start position:0%
as a as that would be my project if if I
got the time to do some vibe coding. Um

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.549 align:start position:0%
here today.
&gt;&gt; But we need to really scientifically
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But we need to really scientifically
00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:12.789 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But we need to really scientifically
rigorously answer the question why.
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
rigorously answer the question why.
00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:15.269 align:start position:0%
rigorously answer the question why.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And which aspect of that can be
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And which aspect of that can be
00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And which aspect of that can be
mapped into the virtual world.
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
mapped into the virtual world.
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
mapped into the virtual world.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; It's not it's not enough to say, "Yeah,
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It's not it's not enough to say, "Yeah,
00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:21.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It's not it's not enough to say, "Yeah,
you should go touch grass and hang out
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
you should go touch grass and hang out
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.549 align:start position:0%
you should go touch grass and hang out
in nature." It's like, why exactly is
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
in nature." It's like, why exactly is
00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
in nature." It's like, why exactly is
that valuable?
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
that valuable?
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.269 align:start position:0%
that valuable?
&gt;&gt; Yes. And I guess that's maybe the thing
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. And I guess that's maybe the thing
00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:29.669 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. And I guess that's maybe the thing
that's been uh haunting me, obsessing me
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's been uh haunting me, obsessing me
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:31.269 align:start position:0%
that's been uh haunting me, obsessing me
from the beginning of my career. If you
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
from the beginning of my career. If you
00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:32.230 align:start position:0%
from the beginning of my career. If you
think about all the different things
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
think about all the different things
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.990 align:start position:0%
think about all the different things
I've done, that's they're all related in
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
I've done, that's they're all related in
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
I've done, that's they're all related in
that way. This simulation, nature of

that way. This simulation, nature of
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.789 align:start position:0%
that way. This simulation, nature of
reality, and what is the bounds of, you
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%

know, what can be modeled. Sorry for the
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.789 align:start position:0%
know, what can be modeled. Sorry for the
ridiculous question, but so far, what is
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
ridiculous question, but so far, what is
00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.230 align:start position:0%
ridiculous question, but so far, what is
the greatest video game of all time?
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
the greatest video game of all time?
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.510 align:start position:0%
the greatest video game of all time?
What's up there?
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
What's up there?
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.029 align:start position:0%
What's up there?
&gt;&gt; Well, my favorite one of all time is
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Well, my favorite one of all time is
00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:49.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Well, my favorite one of all time is
Civilization. I have to say that that
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
Civilization. I have to say that that
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
Civilization. I have to say that that
was the the the Civilization 1 and
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
was the the the Civilization 1 and
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.909 align:start position:0%
was the the the Civilization 1 and
Civilization 2. My favorite games of all
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
Civilization 2. My favorite games of all
00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:55.110 align:start position:0%
Civilization 2. My favorite games of all
time. Um
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
time. Um
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
time. Um
&gt;&gt; I can only assume you've avoided the
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I can only assume you've avoided the
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.269 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I can only assume you've avoided the
most recent one because it would
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
most recent one because it would
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.269 align:start position:0%
most recent one because it would
probably you would that would be your
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
probably you would that would be your
00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.269 align:start position:0%
probably you would that would be your
sobatical that you would disappear.
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
sobatical that you would disappear.
00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:05.110 align:start position:0%
sobatical that you would disappear.
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. They take a lot of time
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. They take a lot of time
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.350 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. They take a lot of time
these Civilization games. So, I got to
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
these Civilization games. So, I got to
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.549 align:start position:0%
these Civilization games. So, I got to
be careful with them.
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
be careful with them.
00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:11.190 align:start position:0%
be careful with them.
&gt;&gt; Fun question. You and Elon seem to be
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Fun question. You and Elon seem to be
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Fun question. You and Elon seem to be
somehow solid gamers. Uh is there a
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
somehow solid gamers. Uh is there a
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.470 align:start position:0%
somehow solid gamers. Uh is there a
connection between being great at gaming
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
connection between being great at gaming
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.350 align:start position:0%
connection between being great at gaming
and and uh being great leaders of AI
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
and and uh being great leaders of AI
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.070 align:start position:0%
and and uh being great leaders of AI
companies?
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
companies?
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.750 align:start position:0%
companies?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I It's an interesting one.
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I It's an interesting one.
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.789 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I It's an interesting one.
I mean uh we both love games and uh it's
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
I mean uh we both love games and uh it's
00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:26.310 align:start position:0%
I mean uh we both love games and uh it's
interesting he wrote games as well to
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
interesting he wrote games as well to
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.870 align:start position:0%
interesting he wrote games as well to
start off with. It's probably especially
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
start off with. It's probably especially
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.789 align:start position:0%
start off with. It's probably especially
in the era I grew up in where home
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the era I grew up in where home
00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.950 align:start position:0%
in the era I grew up in where home
computers were just became a thing, you
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
computers were just became a thing, you
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.310 align:start position:0%
computers were just became a thing, you
know, in the late ' 80s and '9s,
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
know, in the late ' 80s and '9s,
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.070 align:start position:0%
know, in the late ' 80s and '9s,
especially in the UK. I had a Spectrum
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
especially in the UK. I had a Spectrum
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.389 align:start position:0%
especially in the UK. I had a Spectrum
and then a Commodore Omega 500 which is
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
and then a Commodore Omega 500 which is
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:40.389 align:start position:0%
and then a Commodore Omega 500 which is
my my favorite computer ever and that's
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
my my favorite computer ever and that's
00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:42.149 align:start position:0%
my my favorite computer ever and that's
why I learned all my programming and of
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
why I learned all my programming and of
00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:44.630 align:start position:0%
why I learned all my programming and of
course it's a very fun thing uh to
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
course it's a very fun thing uh to
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.350 align:start position:0%
course it's a very fun thing uh to
program is to program games. So I think
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
program is to program games. So I think
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.190 align:start position:0%
program is to program games. So I think
it's a great way to learn programming
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's a great way to learn programming
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.710 align:start position:0%
it's a great way to learn programming
probably still is and um and then of
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
probably still is and um and then of
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.990 align:start position:0%
probably still is and um and then of
course I immediately took it in
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
course I immediately took it in
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.909 align:start position:0%
course I immediately took it in
directions of AI and simulations which
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
directions of AI and simulations which
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:58.630 align:start position:0%
directions of AI and simulations which
so I may was able to express my interest
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
so I may was able to express my interest
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
so I may was able to express my interest
in in games and my sort of wider
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
in in games and my sort of wider
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
in in games and my sort of wider
scientific interests alto together. And
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
scientific interests alto together. And
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.350 align:start position:0%
scientific interests alto together. And
then the final thing I think that's
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
then the final thing I think that's
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.909 align:start position:0%
then the final thing I think that's
great about games is it fuses um
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
great about games is it fuses um
00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:11.669 align:start position:0%
great about games is it fuses um
artistic design, you know, art with the
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
artistic design, you know, art with the
00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:14.389 align:start position:0%
artistic design, you know, art with the
the the most cutting edge programming.
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
the the most cutting edge programming.
00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.870 align:start position:0%
the the most cutting edge programming.
Um so again, in the '90s, all of the
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
Um so again, in the '90s, all of the
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.110 align:start position:0%
Um so again, in the '90s, all of the
most interesting uh technical advances
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
most interesting uh technical advances
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
most interesting uh technical advances
were happening in gaming, whether that
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
were happening in gaming, whether that
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.909 align:start position:0%
were happening in gaming, whether that
was AI, graphics, physics engines, uh
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
was AI, graphics, physics engines, uh
00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
was AI, graphics, physics engines, uh
hardware, even GPUs of course were
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
hardware, even GPUs of course were
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.230 align:start position:0%
hardware, even GPUs of course were
designed for gaming originally. Um so
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
designed for gaming originally. Um so
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
designed for gaming originally. Um so
everything that was pushing computing
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
everything that was pushing computing
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.630 align:start position:0%
everything that was pushing computing
forward in the in the '9s was due to
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
forward in the in the '9s was due to
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.269 align:start position:0%
forward in the in the '9s was due to
gaming. So interestingly that was where
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
gaming. So interestingly that was where
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:37.269 align:start position:0%
gaming. So interestingly that was where
the forefront of research was going on
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
the forefront of research was going on
00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:39.029 align:start position:0%
the forefront of research was going on
and it was this incredible fusion with
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
and it was this incredible fusion with
00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:42.789 align:start position:0%
and it was this incredible fusion with
with art um you know graphics but also
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
with art um you know graphics but also
00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
with art um you know graphics but also
music and just the whole new media of
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
music and just the whole new media of
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.029 align:start position:0%
music and just the whole new media of
storytelling and I love that. For me
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
storytelling and I love that. For me
00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:48.870 align:start position:0%
storytelling and I love that. For me
it's this sort of multi-disiplinary kind

evolution search.
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:23.750 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.230 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So evolutionary algorithms are doing the
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So evolutionary algorithms are doing the
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So evolutionary algorithms are doing the
search and LLMs are telling you where.
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
search and LLMs are telling you where.
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.630 align:start position:0%
search and LLMs are telling you where.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. So LLMs are kind of
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. So LLMs are kind of
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.549 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. So LLMs are kind of
proposing some possible solutions and
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
proposing some possible solutions and
00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.389 align:start position:0%
proposing some possible solutions and
then you do you use evolutionary
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
then you do you use evolutionary
00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:37.350 align:start position:0%
then you do you use evolutionary
computing on top to to to find some
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.070 align:start position:0%

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%

So actually I think it's an example of
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
So actually I think it's an example of
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.470 align:start position:0%
So actually I think it's an example of
very promising directions where you
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
very promising directions where you
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.909 align:start position:0%
very promising directions where you

there's quite a lot of interesting uh

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:57.029 align:start position:0%

you need some kind of search process on

you need some kind of search process on

So, you have to have some objective

So, you have to have some objective

So it's not just Monte Carlo tree search

&gt;&gt; You could every once in a while

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.349 align:start position:0%

know what evolution is really good at is
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
know what evolution is really good at is
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:32.310 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; So that component is super interesting
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; As for conjecture,
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; As for conjecture,
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; As for conjecture,
the you want to come up with a thing
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
the you want to come up with a thing
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.950 align:start position:0%
the you want to come up with a thing
that's interesting and amenable to
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and amenable to
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.510 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and amenable to
proof.
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
proof.
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.069 align:start position:0%
proof.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So like it's easy to come up with a
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So like it's easy to come up with a
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.790 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So like it's easy to come up with a
thing that's extremely difficult.
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
thing that's extremely difficult.
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.190 align:start position:0%
thing that's extremely difficult.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.630 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's easy to come up with a thing that's
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It's easy to come up with a thing that's
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.390 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It's easy to come up with a thing that's
extremely easy. at that at that very
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
extremely easy. at that at that very
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:48.710 align:start position:0%
extremely easy. at that at that very

&gt;&gt; that sweet spot, right, of of basically
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; that sweet spot, right, of of basically
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; that sweet spot, right, of of basically
advancing the science and splitting the
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
advancing the science and splitting the
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.710 align:start position:0%
advancing the science and splitting the
hypothesis space into two ideally,
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
hypothesis space into two ideally,
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.550 align:start position:0%
hypothesis space into two ideally,
right? Whether if it's true or not true,
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
right? Whether if it's true or not true,
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
right? Whether if it's true or not true,
you you've learned something really
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
you you've learned something really
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.990 align:start position:0%
you you've learned something really
useful and um and and that's hard and
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
useful and um and and that's hard and
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
useful and um and and that's hard and
and and and making something that's also
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and and making something that's also
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.230 align:start position:0%
and and and making something that's also
uh you know falsifiable and within sort
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know falsifiable and within sort
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.069 align:start position:0%
uh you know falsifiable and within sort
of the technologies that you have you
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
of the technologies that you have you
00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.870 align:start position:0%
of the technologies that you have you
currently have available. So it's a very
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
currently have available. So it's a very
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.950 align:start position:0%
currently have available. So it's a very
creative process actually highly
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
creative process actually highly
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.910 align:start position:0%
creative process actually highly
creative process that um I think just a
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
creative process that um I think just a
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
creative process that um I think just a
kind of naive search on top of a model
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
kind of naive search on top of a model
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
kind of naive search on top of a model
won't be enough for that.
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
won't be enough for that.
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.790 align:start position:0%
won't be enough for that.
&gt;&gt; Okay. The idea of splitting the
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Okay. The idea of splitting the
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.390 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Okay. The idea of splitting the
hypothesis space in two is super
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
hypothesis space in two is super
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.710 align:start position:0%
hypothesis space in two is super
interesting. So uh I've heard you say
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
interesting. So uh I've heard you say
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
interesting. So uh I've heard you say
that there's basically no failure in or
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
that there's basically no failure in or
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.829 align:start position:0%
that there's basically no failure in or
failure is extremely valuable if it's
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
failure is extremely valuable if it's
00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:33.349 align:start position:0%
failure is extremely valuable if it's
done if you construct the questions
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
done if you construct the questions
00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:34.790 align:start position:0%
done if you construct the questions
right if you construct the experiments
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
right if you construct the experiments
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.270 align:start position:0%
right if you construct the experiments
right if you design them right that
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
right if you design them right that
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
right if you design them right that
failure success are both useful. So
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
failure success are both useful. So
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.230 align:start position:0%
failure success are both useful. So
perhaps because it splits the hypothesis
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps because it splits the hypothesis
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.829 align:start position:0%
perhaps because it splits the hypothesis
basically two, it's like a binary
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
basically two, it's like a binary
00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:44.310 align:start position:0%
basically two, it's like a binary
search.
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
search.
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.230 align:start position:0%
search.
&gt;&gt; That's right. So when you do like, you
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; That's right. So when you do like, you
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; That's right. So when you do like, you
know, real blue sky research, there's no
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
know, real blue sky research, there's no
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.230 align:start position:0%
know, real blue sky research, there's no
such thing as failure really as long as
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
such thing as failure really as long as
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.670 align:start position:0%
such thing as failure really as long as
you're picking experiments and
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
you're picking experiments and
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
you're picking experiments and
hypotheses that that that that
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
hypotheses that that that that
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.829 align:start position:0%
hypotheses that that that that
meaningfully spit the hypothesis space.
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
meaningfully spit the hypothesis space.
00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.750 align:start position:0%
meaningfully spit the hypothesis space.
So you know, and you learn something,
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
So you know, and you learn something,
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
So you know, and you learn something,
you can learn something kind of equally
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
you can learn something kind of equally
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.670 align:start position:0%
you can learn something kind of equally
valuable from an experiment that doesn't
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
valuable from an experiment that doesn't
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.270 align:start position:0%
valuable from an experiment that doesn't
work. That should tell you, if you've
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
work. That should tell you, if you've
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.950 align:start position:0%
work. That should tell you, if you've
designed the experiment well and your
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
designed the experiment well and your
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.109 align:start position:0%
designed the experiment well and your
hypothesis are interesting, it should
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
hypothesis are interesting, it should
00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:09.109 align:start position:0%
hypothesis are interesting, it should
tell you a lot about where to go next.
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
tell you a lot about where to go next.
00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
tell you a lot about where to go next.
and um and then it's you're effectively
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um and then it's you're effectively
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.309 align:start position:0%
and um and then it's you're effectively
doing a search process um and using that
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
doing a search process um and using that
00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:16.710 align:start position:0%
doing a search process um and using that
information in in you know very helpful
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
information in in you know very helpful
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.870 align:start position:0%
information in in you know very helpful
ways. So to go to your dream
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
ways. So to go to your dream
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
ways. So to go to your dream
of uh modeling a cell uh what are the
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
of uh modeling a cell uh what are the
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.270 align:start position:0%
of uh modeling a cell uh what are the
big challenges that lay ahead for us to
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
big challenges that lay ahead for us to
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.349 align:start position:0%
big challenges that lay ahead for us to
make that happen? We should maybe
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
make that happen? We should maybe
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.670 align:start position:0%
make that happen? We should maybe
highlight that alpha I mean there's just
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
highlight that alpha I mean there's just
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.030 align:start position:0%
highlight that alpha I mean there's just
so many leaps.
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
so many leaps.
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
so many leaps.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.230 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So AlphaFold solved if it's fair to say
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So AlphaFold solved if it's fair to say
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.589 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So AlphaFold solved if it's fair to say
protein folding and there's so many
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
protein folding and there's so many
00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:36.790 align:start position:0%
protein folding and there's so many
incredible things we could talk about
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
incredible things we could talk about
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.829 align:start position:0%
incredible things we could talk about
there including the open sourcing uh the
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
there including the open sourcing uh the
00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:42.150 align:start position:0%
there including the open sourcing uh the
everything you've released. Alpha Fold 3
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
everything you've released. Alpha Fold 3
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.670 align:start position:0%
everything you've released. Alpha Fold 3
is doing protein, RNA, DNA interactions,
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
is doing protein, RNA, DNA interactions,
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.910 align:start position:0%
is doing protein, RNA, DNA interactions,
&gt;&gt; which is super complicated and and
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; which is super complicated and and
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.829 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; which is super complicated and and
fascinating. That's amendable to
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
fascinating. That's amendable to
00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:52.950 align:start position:0%
fascinating. That's amendable to
modeling. Alpha genome uh predicts uh
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
modeling. Alpha genome uh predicts uh
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.430 align:start position:0%

how small genetic changes like if we
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
how small genetic changes like if we
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
how small genetic changes like if we
think about single mutations, how they
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
think about single mutations, how they
00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.030 align:start position:0%
think about single mutations, how they
link to actual uh function. So um those
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
link to actual uh function. So um those
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.510 align:start position:0%
link to actual uh function. So um those
are it seems like it's creeping along to
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
are it seems like it's creeping along to
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.390 align:start position:0%
are it seems like it's creeping along to

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
sophistic to to much more complicated u
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.390 align:start position:0%

things like a cell but a cell has a lot
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
things like a cell but a cell has a lot
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.790 align:start position:0%
things like a cell but a cell has a lot
of really complicated components.
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
of really complicated components.
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.390 align:start position:0%
of really complicated components.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So what I've tried to do
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So what I've tried to do
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So what I've tried to do
throughout my career is I have these
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
throughout my career is I have these
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.550 align:start position:0%

doing most of it in silicone the search

doing most of it in silicone the search
in silicico and then you do the

in silicico and then you do the
00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:21.349 align:start position:0%

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.910 align:start position:0%
full organism that's a single cell right
so it's the kind of simplest single cell
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
so it's the kind of simplest single cell
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.150 align:start position:0%
so it's the kind of simplest single cell
organism and so it's not just a cell

is the first step towards is modeling
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
is the first step towards is modeling
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.790 align:start position:0%
is the first step towards is modeling
those interactions. So first of all
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
those interactions. So first of all
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
those interactions. So first of all
pairwise you know proteins with proteins
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
pairwise you know proteins with proteins
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.750 align:start position:0%
pairwise you know proteins with proteins
proteins with RNA and DNA but then um
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
proteins with RNA and DNA but then um
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.950 align:start position:0%
proteins with RNA and DNA but then um
the next step after that would be
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
the next step after that would be
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.870 align:start position:0%
the next step after that would be
modeling maybe a whole pathway maybe
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
modeling maybe a whole pathway maybe
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.630 align:start position:0%
modeling maybe a whole pathway maybe
like the to pathway that's involved in
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
like the to pathway that's involved in
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.309 align:start position:0%
like the to pathway that's involved in
cancer or something like this and then
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
cancer or something like this and then
00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:30.390 align:start position:0%
cancer or something like this and then
eventually you might be able to model
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
eventually you might be able to model
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
eventually you might be able to model
you know a whole cell
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know a whole cell
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
you know a whole cell
&gt;&gt; also there's another complexity here
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; also there's another complexity here
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.190 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; also there's another complexity here
that stuff in a cell happens at
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
that stuff in a cell happens at
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.230 align:start position:0%
that stuff in a cell happens at
different time scales is that tricky
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
different time scales is that tricky
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.710 align:start position:0%
different time scales is that tricky
like there you know protein uh folding
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
like there you know protein uh folding
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.109 align:start position:0%
like there you know protein uh folding
is you know super fast
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
is you know super fast
00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:44.230 align:start position:0%
is you know super fast
&gt;&gt; yes
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yes
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yes
&gt;&gt; um I don't know all the bi ological
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; um I don't know all the bi ological
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; um I don't know all the bi ological
mechanisms, but some of them take a long
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms, but some of them take a long
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.750 align:start position:0%
mechanisms, but some of them take a long
time. And so is that that's an level. So
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
time. And so is that that's an level. So
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.589 align:start position:0%
time. And so is that that's an level. So
the levels of interaction has a
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
the levels of interaction has a
00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:53.109 align:start position:0%
the levels of interaction has a
different temporal scale that you have
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
different temporal scale that you have
00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:54.069 align:start position:0%
different temporal scale that you have
to be able to model.
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to model.
00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
to be able to model.
&gt;&gt; So that would be hard. So you'd probably
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So that would be hard. So you'd probably
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So that would be hard. So you'd probably
need several simulated systems that can
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
need several simulated systems that can
00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.430 align:start position:0%
need several simulated systems that can
interact at these different temporal
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
interact at these different temporal
00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.750 align:start position:0%
interact at these different temporal
dynamics or at least maybe it's like a
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
dynamics or at least maybe it's like a
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.230 align:start position:0%
dynamics or at least maybe it's like a
hierarchical system. So um you can jump
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
hierarchical system. So um you can jump
00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.390 align:start position:0%
hierarchical system. So um you can jump
up and down the the different temporal
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
up and down the the different temporal
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.150 align:start position:0%
up and down the the different temporal
stages. So can you avoid I mean one of
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
stages. So can you avoid I mean one of
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.470 align:start position:0%
stages. So can you avoid I mean one of
the challenges here is
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
the challenges here is
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.910 align:start position:0%
the challenges here is
not avoid simulating for example the the
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
not avoid simulating for example the the
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.910 align:start position:0%
not avoid simulating for example the the
the quantum mechanical aspects of any of
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
the quantum mechanical aspects of any of
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.710 align:start position:0%
the quantum mechanical aspects of any of
this right you want to not overm model
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
this right you want to not overm model
00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.349 align:start position:0%
this right you want to not overm model
you can skip ahead to just model the
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
you can skip ahead to just model the
00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
you can skip ahead to just model the
really highlevel things that get you a
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
really highlevel things that get you a
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.270 align:start position:0%
really highlevel things that get you a
really good estimate of what's going to
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
really good estimate of what's going to
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:27.589 align:start position:0%
really good estimate of what's going to
happen
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
happen
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:29.030 align:start position:0%
happen
&gt;&gt; so you you got to make a decision when
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; so you you got to make a decision when
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.550 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; so you you got to make a decision when
you're modeling any natural system what
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
you're modeling any natural system what
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
you're modeling any natural system what
is the cutoff level of the granularity
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
is the cutoff level of the granularity
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
is the cutoff level of the granularity
that you're going to model it to that
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
that you're going to model it to that
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.309 align:start position:0%
that you're going to model it to that
then captures the dynamics that you're
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
then captures the dynamics that you're
00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:39.190 align:start position:0%
then captures the dynamics that you're
interested in. So probably for a cell I
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
interested in. So probably for a cell I
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.790 align:start position:0%
interested in. So probably for a cell I
would hope that would be the protein
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
would hope that would be the protein
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.030 align:start position:0%
would hope that would be the protein
level uh and that one wouldn't have to
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
level uh and that one wouldn't have to
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
level uh and that one wouldn't have to
go down to the atomic level. Um so you
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
go down to the atomic level. Um so you
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.230 align:start position:0%
go down to the atomic level. Um so you
know of course that's where alpha volt
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
know of course that's where alpha volt
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.630 align:start position:0%
know of course that's where alpha volt
stock kicks in. So that would be kind of
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
stock kicks in. So that would be kind of
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.589 align:start position:0%
stock kicks in. So that would be kind of
the basis and then you'd build these um
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
the basis and then you'd build these um
00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:56.630 align:start position:0%
the basis and then you'd build these um
uh higher level simulations that um take
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh higher level simulations that um take
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.109 align:start position:0%
uh higher level simulations that um take
those as building blocks and then you
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
those as building blocks and then you
00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:01.829 align:start position:0%
those as building blocks and then you
get the emergent behavior. Apologize for
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
get the emergent behavior. Apologize for
00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:03.829 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; like what's that about? And then like
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.829 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; like what's that about? And then like
last year we had a lot of rain and this
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
last year we had a lot of rain and this
00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:41.670 align:start position:0%
last year we had a lot of rain and this
year we don't have rain. Like what did
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
year we don't have rain. Like what did
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
year we don't have rain. Like what did
we do wrong? Humans have been asking
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
we do wrong? Humans have been asking
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.270 align:start position:0%
we do wrong? Humans have been asking
that question for a long time.
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
that question for a long time.
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.870 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Exactly. So we're quite I guess we've

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.549 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So we're quite I guess we've

developed a lot of mechanisms to cope
00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:50.950 align:start position:0%

just get on with daily life and and and
00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:58.870 align:start position:0%
just get on with daily life and and and
we get we keep ourselves busy right in a

we get we keep ourselves busy right in a

actually experience it one time.
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
actually experience it one time.
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.150 align:start position:0%
actually experience it one time.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And then also to experience the
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And then also to experience the
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.069 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And then also to experience the

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:14.549 align:start position:0%
correct prediction where something will
come and how it's going to evolve. It's
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%

incredible.
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
incredible.
00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:15.829 align:start position:0%
incredible.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
00:52:15.839 --> 00:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You've estimated that we'll have AGI by
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; You've estimated that we'll have AGI by
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; You've estimated that we'll have AGI by
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.069 align:start position:0%
Um so there's interesting questions
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
Um so there's interesting questions
00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:24.230 align:start position:0%
Um so there's interesting questions
around that. How will we actually know
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
around that. How will we actually know
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:29.190 align:start position:0%
around that. How will we actually know
that we got there? Uh and uh what maybe
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
that we got there? Uh and uh what maybe
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.030 align:start position:0%
that we got there? Uh and uh what maybe
the move quote move 37 of AGI.
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
the move quote move 37 of AGI.
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
the move quote move 37 of AGI.
&gt;&gt; My estimate is sort of 50% chance by in
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; My estimate is sort of 50% chance by in
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; My estimate is sort of 50% chance by in
the next 5 years. So you know by 2030
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
the next 5 years. So you know by 2030
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.430 align:start position:0%
the next 5 years. So you know by 2030
let's say and uh so I think there's a
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
let's say and uh so I think there's a
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.109 align:start position:0%
let's say and uh so I think there's a
good chance that that could happen. Part
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
good chance that that could happen. Part
00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:44.710 align:start position:0%
good chance that that could happen. Part
of it is what what is your definition of
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
of it is what what is your definition of
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.390 align:start position:0%
of it is what what is your definition of
AGI? Of course, people are arguing about
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
AGI? Of course, people are arguing about
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.030 align:start position:0%
AGI? Of course, people are arguing about
that now and and uh mine's quite a high
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
that now and and uh mine's quite a high
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.030 align:start position:0%
that now and and uh mine's quite a high
bar and always has been of like can we
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
bar and always has been of like can we
00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.109 align:start position:0%
bar and always has been of like can we
match the cognitive functions that the
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
match the cognitive functions that the
00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:55.190 align:start position:0%
match the cognitive functions that the
brain has, right? So, we know our brains
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
brain has, right? So, we know our brains
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.109 align:start position:0%
brain has, right? So, we know our brains
are pretty much general cheuring
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
are pretty much general cheuring
00:52:57.119 --> 00:52:59.829 align:start position:0%
are pretty much general cheuring
machines approximate. And of course,
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
machines approximate. And of course,
00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:01.829 align:start position:0%
machines approximate. And of course,
we've created incredible modern
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
we've created incredible modern
00:53:01.839 --> 00:53:04.069 align:start position:0%
we've created incredible modern
civilization with our minds. So, that
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
civilization with our minds. So, that
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:06.710 align:start position:0%
civilization with our minds. So, that
also speaks to how general the brain is.
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
also speaks to how general the brain is.
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.670 align:start position:0%
also speaks to how general the brain is.
And um for us to know we have a true
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
And um for us to know we have a true
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.829 align:start position:0%
And um for us to know we have a true
AGI, we would have to like make sure
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
AGI, we would have to like make sure
00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:13.670 align:start position:0%

that it has all those capabilities. it

that it has all those capabilities. it

like today's systems but other things
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.829 align:start position:0%
like today's systems but other things
it's really uh flawed at and and that's

it's really uh flawed at and and that's
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:23.030 align:start position:0%
it's really uh flawed at and and that's
what we currently have with today's

what we currently have with today's

I wonder if it will take something like
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.670 align:start position:0%
I wonder if it will take something like
a move 37 so on the positive side versus

a move 37 so on the positive side versus

00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
like
00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
like

where it would be one or two where it's

like yes, holy this is

like yes, holy this is
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.069 align:start position:0%
like yes, holy this is
&gt;&gt; I think exactly. So I think there's the
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think exactly. So I think there's the
00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.069 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think exactly. So I think there's the
sort of blanket testing to just make
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
sort of blanket testing to just make
00:55:18.079 --> 00:55:20.390 align:start position:0%
sort of blanket testing to just make
sure you've got the consistency, but I
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
sure you've got the consistency, but I
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.190 align:start position:0%
sure you've got the consistency, but I
think there are the sort of lighthouse
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
think there are the sort of lighthouse
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.230 align:start position:0%
think there are the sort of lighthouse
moments like the move 37 that I would be
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
moments like the move 37 that I would be
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.190 align:start position:0%
moments like the move 37 that I would be
looking for. So one would be inventing a

new conjecture or new hypothesis about
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.630 align:start position:0%
new conjecture or new hypothesis about

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
physics like Einstein did. So maybe you
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.150 align:start position:0%
physics like Einstein did. So maybe you
could even run the back test of that
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
could even run the back test of that
00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.470 align:start position:0%
could even run the back test of that
very rigorously like have a cut off of

very rigorously like have a cut off of
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
very rigorously like have a cut off of
knowledge cutff of 1900 and then give
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge cutff of 1900 and then give
00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:43.030 align:start position:0%

the system everything that was you know
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
the system everything that was you know
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.349 align:start position:0%

that was written up to 1900 and then and
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
that was written up to 1900 and then and
00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:47.030 align:start position:0%
that was written up to 1900 and then and
then see if it could come up with
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
then see if it could come up with
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.230 align:start position:0%
then see if it could come up with

special relativity and general
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.069 align:start position:0%

another one would be can it invent a

another one would be can it invent a

37 a new strategy but can it invent a

37 a new strategy but can it invent a

00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
able to do uh uh several of those
00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:11.349 align:start position:0%
able to do uh uh several of those
things, right, for it to be very
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
things, right, for it to be very
00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:14.150 align:start position:0%
things, right, for it to be very
general. Um not just one domain. And so
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
general. Um not just one domain. And so
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.230 align:start position:0%
general. Um not just one domain. And so
I think that would be the signs at least
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
I think that would be the signs at least
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.069 align:start position:0%
I think that would be the signs at least
that I would be looking for that we've
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
that I would be looking for that we've
00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:20.870 align:start position:0%
that I would be looking for that we've
got a system that's a GI level. And then
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
got a system that's a GI level. And then
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.549 align:start position:0%
got a system that's a GI level. And then
maybe to fill that out, you would also
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
maybe to fill that out, you would also
00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:24.470 align:start position:0%
maybe to fill that out, you would also
check the consistency, you know, make
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
check the consistency, you know, make
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
check the consistency, you know, make
sure there's no holes in that system
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
sure there's no holes in that system
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.190 align:start position:0%
sure there's no holes in that system
either.
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
either.
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
either.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Something like a new conjecture or
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Something like a new conjecture or
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Something like a new conjecture or
scientific discovery. That would be a
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
scientific discovery. That would be a
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.430 align:start position:0%
scientific discovery. That would be a
cool feeling. Yeah, that would be
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
cool feeling. Yeah, that would be
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.950 align:start position:0%
cool feeling. Yeah, that would be
amazing. So, it's not not just helping
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
amazing. So, it's not not just helping
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.630 align:start position:0%
amazing. So, it's not not just helping
us do that, but actually coming up with
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
us do that, but actually coming up with
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
us do that, but actually coming up with
something brand new
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
something brand new
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.390 align:start position:0%
something brand new
&gt;&gt; and you would be in the room for that.
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and you would be in the room for that.
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and you would be in the room for that.
So, it would be like probably 2 or 3
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
So, it would be like probably 2 or 3
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
So, it would be like probably 2 or 3
months before announcing it.
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
months before announcing it.
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:45.589 align:start position:0%
months before announcing it.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:47.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And you would just be sitting there
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And you would just be sitting there
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And you would just be sitting there
trying not to tweet
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
trying not to tweet
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.589 align:start position:0%
trying not to tweet
&gt;&gt; something like that. Exactly. It's like
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; something like that. Exactly. It's like
00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:53.589 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; something like that. Exactly. It's like
what is this amazing new you know
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
what is this amazing new you know
00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:55.589 align:start position:0%
what is this amazing new you know
physics idea? And then we would probably
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
physics idea? And then we would probably
00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:57.670 align:start position:0%
physics idea? And then we would probably
check it with world experts in that
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
check it with world experts in that
00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.870 align:start position:0%
check it with world experts in that

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.870 align:start position:0%

guess it would be explaining its

guess it would be explaining its
00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:07.190 align:start position:0%
guess it would be explaining its
workings too. Um yeah be an amazing
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
workings too. Um yeah be an amazing
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:07.670 align:start position:0%
workings too. Um yeah be an amazing
moment.
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.910 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Do you worry that we as humans even
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Do you worry that we as humans even
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.150 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Do you worry that we as humans even

&gt;&gt; it may be pretty complicated. So it
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; it may be pretty complicated. So it
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; it may be pretty complicated. So it
could be the analogy I give there is I
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
could be the analogy I give there is I
00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.549 align:start position:0%
could be the analogy I give there is I
don't think it will be um uh uh totally

don't think it will be um uh uh totally

come up with that move but they could
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.870 align:start position:0%
come up with that move but they could

explain why afterwards that move made

that would be very possible for the best

that would be very possible for the best

&gt;&gt; But I wonder maybe you can you can
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But I wonder maybe you can you can
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.630 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But I wonder maybe you can you can
educate me on the side of go. I wonder
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
educate me on the side of go. I wonder
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.710 align:start position:0%
educate me on the side of go. I wonder
if there's moves for Agnes or Gary where

if there's moves for Agnes or Gary where

if there's moves for Agnes or Gary where
they at first will dismiss it as a bad

they at first will dismiss it as a bad

they at first will dismiss it as a bad

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
move.
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.789 align:start position:0%
move.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. It could be. But then
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. It could be. But then
00:58:04.799 --> 00:58:06.470 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. It could be. But then
afterwards they'll figure out with their
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
afterwards they'll figure out with their
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.710 align:start position:0%
afterwards they'll figure out with their
intuition that that this why this works.
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
intuition that that this why this works.
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.390 align:start position:0%
intuition that that this why this works.
And then and then and then empirically
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%

the nice thing about games is one of the

the nice thing about games is one of the
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.670 align:start position:0%
the nice thing about games is one of the
great things about games is you can it's
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
great things about games is you can it's
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.270 align:start position:0%
great things about games is you can it's
a sort of scientific test. Does it do
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
a sort of scientific test. Does it do
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.910 align:start position:0%
a sort of scientific test. Does it do
you win the game or not win? And then um
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
you win the game or not win? And then um
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.549 align:start position:0%
you win the game or not win? And then um
that tells you okay that move in the end
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
that tells you okay that move in the end
00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:22.950 align:start position:0%
that tells you okay that move in the end
was good. That strategy was good. And
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
was good. That strategy was good. And
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.470 align:start position:0%
was good. That strategy was good. And
then you can go back and analyze that
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
then you can go back and analyze that
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.789 align:start position:0%
then you can go back and analyze that
and and and and explain even to yourself
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
and and and and explain even to yourself
00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:29.430 align:start position:0%
and and and and explain even to yourself
a little bit more why explore around it.
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit more why explore around it.
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.270 align:start position:0%
a little bit more why explore around it.
And that's how chess analysis and things
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
And that's how chess analysis and things
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.950 align:start position:0%
And that's how chess analysis and things
like that works. So perhaps that's why
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
like that works. So perhaps that's why
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.710 align:start position:0%
like that works. So perhaps that's why

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And they're going to be pretty

be you can imagine also AI systems that

whereas if you know if you wanted a big
leap in uh understanding you need a you
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
leap in uh understanding you need a you
01:01:31.359 --> 01:01:34.230 align:start position:0%
leap in uh understanding you need a you
need a much larger uh advance.
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
need a much larger uh advance.
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
need a much larger uh advance.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But it could also be sort of to
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But it could also be sort of to
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But it could also be sort of to
push back against hard takeoff scenario.
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
push back against hard takeoff scenario.
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.150 align:start position:0%
push back against hard takeoff scenario.
It could be just a sequence of um
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
It could be just a sequence of um
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
It could be just a sequence of um
incremental improvements like matrix
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
incremental improvements like matrix
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.390 align:start position:0%
incremental improvements like matrix

multiplication like it has to sit there
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.030 align:start position:0%
multiplication like it has to sit there
for days thinking how to incrementally
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
for days thinking how to incrementally
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.030 align:start position:0%
for days thinking how to incrementally
improve a thing and that it does so
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
improve a thing and that it does so
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.030 align:start position:0%
improve a thing and that it does so
recursively and as you do more and more
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
recursively and as you do more and more
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
recursively and as you do more and more
improvement it'll slow down so there'll
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
improvement it'll slow down so there'll
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.870 align:start position:0%
improvement it'll slow down so there'll
be like a like uh the path to AGI won't
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
be like a like uh the path to AGI won't
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.470 align:start position:0%
be like a like uh the path to AGI won't
be like a it'll be a gradual improvement
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
be like a it'll be a gradual improvement
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.109 align:start position:0%
be like a it'll be a gradual improvement
over time.
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
over time.
01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.710 align:start position:0%
over time.
&gt;&gt; Yes. If it was just incremental
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. If it was just incremental
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.309 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. If it was just incremental
improvements that's how it would look.
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
improvements that's how it would look.
01:02:06.319 --> 01:02:08.470 align:start position:0%
improvements that's how it would look.
So the question is could it come up with
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
So the question is could it come up with
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.150 align:start position:0%
So the question is could it come up with
a new leap like the transformers
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
a new leap like the transformers
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.829 align:start position:0%
a new leap like the transformers
architecture right could it have done
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
architecture right could it have done
01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
architecture right could it have done
that back in 2017 when you know we did
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
that back in 2017 when you know we did
01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.030 align:start position:0%
that back in 2017 when you know we did
it and brain did it and it's it's not
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
it and brain did it and it's it's not
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.270 align:start position:0%
it and brain did it and it's it's not
clear that that these systems something
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
clear that that these systems something
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.030 align:start position:0%
clear that that these systems something
like Alpha wouldn't be able to do make
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
like Alpha wouldn't be able to do make
01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.270 align:start position:0%
like Alpha wouldn't be able to do make
such a big leap so for sure these
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
such a big leap so for sure these
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.789 align:start position:0%
such a big leap so for sure these
systems are good we have systems I think
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
systems are good we have systems I think
01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
systems are good we have systems I think
that can do incremental hill climbing
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
that can do incremental hill climbing
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.309 align:start position:0%
that can do incremental hill climbing
and that's a kind of bigger question
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
and that's a kind of bigger question
01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:29.910 align:start position:0%
and that's a kind of bigger question
about is that all that's needed from
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
about is that all that's needed from
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.150 align:start position:0%
about is that all that's needed from
here or do we actually need one or two
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
here or do we actually need one or two
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.470 align:start position:0%
here or do we actually need one or two
more um uh big breakthroughs
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
more um uh big breakthroughs
01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
more um uh big breakthroughs
&gt;&gt; and can the same kind of systems provide
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and can the same kind of systems provide
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and can the same kind of systems provide
the breakthroughs also. So make it a
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
the breakthroughs also. So make it a
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.829 align:start position:0%
the breakthroughs also. So make it a
bunch of scurves like incremental
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
bunch of scurves like incremental
01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.829 align:start position:0%
bunch of scurves like incremental
improvement but also every once in a
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%

while leaps.
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
while leaps.
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.789 align:start position:0%
while leaps.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think anyone has systems
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think anyone has systems
01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:49.589 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think anyone has systems
that can have shown unequivocally those
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
that can have shown unequivocally those
01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
that can have shown unequivocally those
big leaps that the the right. We have a
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
big leaps that the the right. We have a
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.190 align:start position:0%
big leaps that the the right. We have a
lot of systems that do the hill climbing
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
lot of systems that do the hill climbing
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.109 align:start position:0%
lot of systems that do the hill climbing
of the S-curve that you're currently on.
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
of the S-curve that you're currently on.
01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
of the S-curve that you're currently on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that would be the move 37 is a
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that would be the move 37 is a
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:57.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that would be the move 37 is a
leap.
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
leap.
01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.910 align:start position:0%
leap.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think would be a leap. Um
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think would be a leap. Um
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.630 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think would be a leap. Um
something like that. Uh do you think the
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
something like that. Uh do you think the
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.950 align:start position:0%
something like that. Uh do you think the
scaling laws are holding strong on the
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
scaling laws are holding strong on the
01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.630 align:start position:0%
scaling laws are holding strong on the
pre-training, post- training, test time,
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
pre-training, post- training, test time,
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.069 align:start position:0%
pre-training, post- training, test time,
compute? Uh do you uh on the flip side
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
compute? Uh do you uh on the flip side
01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:12.549 align:start position:0%
compute? Uh do you uh on the flip side
of that anticipate AI progress hitting a
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
of that anticipate AI progress hitting a
01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
of that anticipate AI progress hitting a
wall?
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
wall?
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
wall?
&gt;&gt; We certainly feel there's a lot more
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; We certainly feel there's a lot more
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.150 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; We certainly feel there's a lot more
room just in the scaling. So um actually
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
room just in the scaling. So um actually
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.150 align:start position:0%
room just in the scaling. So um actually
all steps pre-training, post-training
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
all steps pre-training, post-training
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.670 align:start position:0%
all steps pre-training, post-training
and inference time. So uh there's sort
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
and inference time. So uh there's sort
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.670 align:start position:0%
and inference time. So uh there's sort
of three scalings that are happening
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
of three scalings that are happening
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.950 align:start position:0%
of three scalings that are happening
concurrently. Um and we again there it's
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
concurrently. Um and we again there it's
01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.150 align:start position:0%
concurrently. Um and we again there it's

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
about how innovative you can be and we
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.589 align:start position:0%
about how innovative you can be and we
you know we pride ourselves on having

incredible uh researchers and uh people
like Nam Shazir who you know came up
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
like Nam Shazir who you know came up
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.190 align:start position:0%

know who led the Alph Go project and so
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
know who led the Alph Go project and so
01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:50.950 align:start position:0%
know who led the Alph Go project and so

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.670 align:start position:0%

base means that if some new new
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
base means that if some new new
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.990 align:start position:0%

breakthrough is required like an Alph Go
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
breakthrough is required like an Alph Go
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.470 align:start position:0%
breakthrough is required like an Alph Go
or Transformers uh I would back us to be
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
or Transformers uh I would back us to be
01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
or Transformers uh I would back us to be
the place that does that. So I'm
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
the place that does that. So I'm
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
the place that does that. So I'm
actually quite like it when the terrain
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually quite like it when the terrain
01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.349 align:start position:0%
actually quite like it when the terrain
gets harder, right? Because then it
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
gets harder, right? Because then it
01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:06.309 align:start position:0%
gets harder, right? Because then it
veers more from just engineering to to
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
veers more from just engineering to to
01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:08.309 align:start position:0%
veers more from just engineering to to
true research and you know re or
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
true research and you know re or
01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:10.069 align:start position:0%
true research and you know re or
research plus engineering and that's our
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
research plus engineering and that's our
01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
research plus engineering and that's our
sweet spot. And I I think that's harder
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
sweet spot. And I I think that's harder
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
sweet spot. And I I think that's harder
it's harder to invent things than to
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's harder to invent things than to
01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.630 align:start position:0%
it's harder to invent things than to
than to um you know fast follow. And um
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
than to um you know fast follow. And um
01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
than to um you know fast follow. And um
so you know we don't know I would say
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
so you know we don't know I would say
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.430 align:start position:0%
so you know we don't know I would say
it's a it's kind of 50/50 whether new
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's kind of 50/50 whether new

it's a it's kind of 50/50 whether new
things are needed or whether the scaling
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
things are needed or whether the scaling

the existing stuff is going to be
01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:29.670 align:start position:0%
the existing stuff is going to be

fashion, we're pushing both of those as
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
fashion, we're pushing both of those as
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.470 align:start position:0%

back that to continue hopefully
01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.710 align:start position:0%
back that to continue hopefully
&gt;&gt; uh so on the data side are you concerned
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; uh so on the data side are you concerned
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.630 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; uh so on the data side are you concerned
about running out of highquality data
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
about running out of highquality data
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
about running out of highquality data
especially high quality human data
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
especially high quality human data
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.630 align:start position:0%
especially high quality human data
&gt;&gt; I'm not very worried about that partly
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I'm not very worried about that partly
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I'm not very worried about that partly
because I think there's enough data uh
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
because I think there's enough data uh
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.710 align:start position:0%
because I think there's enough data uh
or and it's been proven to get the
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
or and it's been proven to get the
01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
or and it's been proven to get the
systems to be pretty good and this goes
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
systems to be pretty good and this goes
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.510 align:start position:0%
systems to be pretty good and this goes
back to simulations again if you do you
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
back to simulations again if you do you
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.150 align:start position:0%
back to simulations again if you do you
have enough data to make simulations or
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
have enough data to make simulations or
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.230 align:start position:0%
have enough data to make simulations or
so that you can create more synthetic
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
so that you can create more synthetic
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
so that you can create more synthetic
data that are from the right
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
data that are from the right
01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.470 align:start position:0%
data that are from the right
distribution. Obviously, that's the key.
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
distribution. Obviously, that's the key.
01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.390 align:start position:0%
distribution. Obviously, that's the key.
So, you need enough real world data in
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
So, you need enough real world data in
01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.630 align:start position:0%
So, you need enough real world data in
order to be able to uh uh create those
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
order to be able to uh uh create those
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.270 align:start position:0%
order to be able to uh uh create those
kinds of generator data generators and
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of generator data generators and
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.870 align:start position:0%
kinds of generator data generators and
um I think that we're at that step at
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that we're at that step at
01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
um I think that we're at that step at
the moment.
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
the moment.
01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.710 align:start position:0%
the moment.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've done a lot of incredible
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've done a lot of incredible
01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've done a lot of incredible
stuff on the side of science and biology
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
stuff on the side of science and biology
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.069 align:start position:0%
stuff on the side of science and biology
doing a lot with not so much data.
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
doing a lot with not so much data.
01:06:12.079 --> 01:06:12.390 align:start position:0%
doing a lot with not so much data.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's still a lot of data, but I
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's still a lot of data, but I
01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.349 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's still a lot of data, but I
guess enough
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
guess enough
01:06:15.359 --> 01:06:17.029 align:start position:0%
guess enough
&gt;&gt; take off that going. Exactly. Yeah.
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; take off that going. Exactly. Yeah.
01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.630 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; take off that going. Exactly. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So exactly
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So exactly
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So exactly
&gt;&gt; uh how crucial is the scaling of compute
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; uh how crucial is the scaling of compute
01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.789 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; uh how crucial is the scaling of compute
to building AGI? This is a question
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
to building AGI? This is a question
01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:25.670 align:start position:0%
to building AGI? This is a question
that's an engineering question. It's a
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's an engineering question. It's a
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.309 align:start position:0%
that's an engineering question. It's a
almost geopolitical question
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
almost geopolitical question
01:06:28.319 --> 01:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
almost geopolitical question
&gt;&gt; because it also integrated into that is
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; because it also integrated into that is
01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.069 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; because it also integrated into that is
the supply chains and energy a thing
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
the supply chains and energy a thing
01:06:34.079 --> 01:06:36.069 align:start position:0%
the supply chains and energy a thing
that you care a lot about which is um
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
that you care a lot about which is um
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
that you care a lot about which is um
potentially fusion. So innovating on the
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
potentially fusion. So innovating on the
01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:40.069 align:start position:0%
potentially fusion. So innovating on the
side of energy also. Do you think we're
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
side of energy also. Do you think we're
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
side of energy also. Do you think we're
going to keep scaling compute?
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to keep scaling compute?
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
going to keep scaling compute?
&gt;&gt; I think so for several reasons. I think
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think so for several reasons. I think
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think so for several reasons. I think
compute there's there's the amount of
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
compute there's there's the amount of
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
compute there's there's the amount of
compute you have for training often it
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
compute you have for training often it
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
compute you have for training often it
needs to be colloccated so actually even
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be colloccated so actually even
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.750 align:start position:0%
needs to be colloccated so actually even
like you know uh bandwidth constraints
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
like you know uh bandwidth constraints
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.069 align:start position:0%
like you know uh bandwidth constraints
between data centers can affect that so
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
between data centers can affect that so
01:06:54.079 --> 01:06:55.750 align:start position:0%
between data centers can affect that so
it's it's it's there's additional
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's there's additional
01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's there's additional
constraints even there and that that's
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
constraints even there and that that's
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.589 align:start position:0%
constraints even there and that that's
important for training obviously the
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
important for training obviously the
01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
important for training obviously the
largest models you can but there's also
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
largest models you can but there's also
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.950 align:start position:0%
largest models you can but there's also
because now AI systems are in products
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%

of that there's the thinking systems,
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
of that there's the thinking systems,
01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.069 align:start position:0%
of that there's the thinking systems,
the new paradigm uh of the last year
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
the new paradigm uh of the last year
01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
the new paradigm uh of the last year
that uh where they get smarter the
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
that uh where they get smarter the
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.670 align:start position:0%
that uh where they get smarter the
longer amount of inference time you give
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
longer amount of inference time you give
01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.750 align:start position:0%
longer amount of inference time you give
them at test time. So all of those
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
them at test time. So all of those
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.630 align:start position:0%
them at test time. So all of those
things need a lot of compute and I don't
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
things need a lot of compute and I don't
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
things need a lot of compute and I don't
really see that slowing down. Um and as
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
really see that slowing down. Um and as
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.750 align:start position:0%
really see that slowing down. Um and as
AI systems become better, they'll become
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
AI systems become better, they'll become
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.270 align:start position:0%
AI systems become better, they'll become
more useful and there'll be more demand
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
more useful and there'll be more demand
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
more useful and there'll be more demand
for them. So both from the training
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
for them. So both from the training
01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.630 align:start position:0%
for them. So both from the training
side, the training side actually is is
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
side, the training side actually is is
01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
side, the training side actually is is
only just one part of that. It may even
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
only just one part of that. It may even
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
only just one part of that. It may even
become the smaller part of of what's
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
become the smaller part of of what's
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
become the smaller part of of what's
needed um uh in the overall compute that
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
needed um uh in the overall compute that
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
needed um uh in the overall compute that
that's required. Yeah, that's one sort
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's required. Yeah, that's one sort
01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.910 align:start position:0%
that's required. Yeah, that's one sort
of almost memey kind of thing which is
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
of almost memey kind of thing which is
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.589 align:start position:0%
of almost memey kind of thing which is
like the success and the incredible
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
like the success and the incredible
01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
like the success and the incredible

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
aspects of V3 there people kind of make
01:07:51.599 --> 01:07:53.109 align:start position:0%
aspects of V3 there people kind of make
fun of like the more successful it
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly the difference in
01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.029 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly the difference in
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. We did a little

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. We did a little
01:07:59.039 --> 01:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. We did a little

things and um that's right and and and
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
things and um that's right and and and
01:08:04.319 --> 01:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
things and um that's right and and and
we're going to have to figure out how to
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to figure out how to
01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:07.829 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to figure out how to
do that. Um there's a lot of interesting
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
do that. Um there's a lot of interesting
01:08:07.839 --> 01:08:09.270 align:start position:0%
do that. Um there's a lot of interesting
hardware innovations that we do as you
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
hardware innovations that we do as you
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.270 align:start position:0%

know we have our own TPU line and we're
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
know we have our own TPU line and we're
looking at like inference only things
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
looking at like inference only things
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.789 align:start position:0%
looking at like inference only things
inference only chips and how we can make
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
inference only chips and how we can make
01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:16.630 align:start position:0%
inference only chips and how we can make
those more efficient. We're also very
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
those more efficient. We're also very
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.229 align:start position:0%
those more efficient. We're also very
interested in building AI systems and we
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
interested in building AI systems and we
01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:21.189 align:start position:0%
interested in building AI systems and we
have done the help with energy usage so
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
have done the help with energy usage so
01:08:21.199 --> 01:08:24.070 align:start position:0%
have done the help with energy usage so

um and then eventually things like
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
um and then eventually things like
01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.990 align:start position:0%
um and then eventually things like

reactors. We've done lots of work on
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
reactors. We've done lots of work on
01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:36.550 align:start position:0%
reactors. We've done lots of work on
that with Commonwealth Fusion and also
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
that with Commonwealth Fusion and also
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
that with Commonwealth Fusion and also
uh one could imagine reactor design. Um
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh one could imagine reactor design. Um
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
uh one could imagine reactor design. Um
and then material design I think is one
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
and then material design I think is one
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
and then material design I think is one
of the most exciting new types of solar

the ridiculous question, but what what
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
the ridiculous question, but what what
01:09:08.239 --> 01:09:11.189 align:start position:0%

in like 20, 30, 40 years, do you think
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
in like 20, 30, 40 years, do you think
01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:15.510 align:start position:0%
in like 20, 30, 40 years, do you think
it's going to be nuclear fusion?
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be nuclear fusion?
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.990 align:start position:0%
it's going to be nuclear fusion?
&gt;&gt; I think fusion and solar are the two
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think fusion and solar are the two
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.189 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think fusion and solar are the two
that I I would bet on. Um solar, I mean,
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
that I I would bet on. Um solar, I mean,
01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:22.630 align:start position:0%
that I I would bet on. Um solar, I mean,
you know, it's the fusion reactor in the
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know, it's the fusion reactor in the
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
you know, it's the fusion reactor in the
sky, of course, and I think really the
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
sky, of course, and I think really the
01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.269 align:start position:0%
sky, of course, and I think really the
problem there is is is batteries and
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
problem there is is is batteries and
01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:29.669 align:start position:0%
problem there is is is batteries and
transmission. So you know as well as
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
transmission. So you know as well as
01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:30.950 align:start position:0%
transmission. So you know as well as
more efficient more and more efficient
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
more efficient more and more efficient
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.950 align:start position:0%
more efficient more and more efficient
solar material perhaps eventually you
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%

know in space you know these kind of
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
know in space you know these kind of

think is definitely doable seems uh if
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
think is definitely doable seems uh if
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.829 align:start position:0%

we have the right design of reactor and
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
we have the right design of reactor and
01:09:43.839 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
we have the right design of reactor and
we can control the plasma and uh fast
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
we can control the plasma and uh fast
01:09:46.159 --> 01:09:48.709 align:start position:0%
we can control the plasma and uh fast
enough and so on and I think both of
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
enough and so on and I think both of
01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:50.550 align:start position:0%
enough and so on and I think both of
those things will actually get solved so
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
those things will actually get solved so
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.910 align:start position:0%
those things will actually get solved so
we'll probably have at least those will

we'll probably have at least those will
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.149 align:start position:0%
we'll probably have at least those will

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.510 align:start position:0%
100 years from now, how much would you
be surprised if we've passed a type one
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
be surprised if we've passed a type one
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
be surprised if we've passed a type one
card scale civilization? I would not be
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
card scale civilization? I would not be
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.709 align:start position:0%
card scale civilization? I would not be
that surprised if there was a like a
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
that surprised if there was a like a
01:10:14.719 --> 01:10:16.709 align:start position:0%
that surprised if there was a like a
100redyear time scale from here. I mean,
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
100redyear time scale from here. I mean,
01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
100redyear time scale from here. I mean,
I think it's pretty clear if we crack
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's pretty clear if we crack
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.470 align:start position:0%
I think it's pretty clear if we crack
the energy problems in one of the ways
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
the energy problems in one of the ways
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
the energy problems in one of the ways
we've just discussed, fusion or or very
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
we've just discussed, fusion or or very
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.229 align:start position:0%
we've just discussed, fusion or or very
efficient solar, um, then if energy is
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
efficient solar, um, then if energy is
01:10:26.239 --> 01:10:28.950 align:start position:0%
efficient solar, um, then if energy is
kind of free and renewable and clean,
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
kind of free and renewable and clean,
01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.510 align:start position:0%
kind of free and renewable and clean,
um, then that solves a whole bunch of
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
um, then that solves a whole bunch of
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.270 align:start position:0%
um, then that solves a whole bunch of
other problems. So, for example, the
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
other problems. So, for example, the
01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.590 align:start position:0%
other problems. So, for example, the
water access problem goes away because
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
water access problem goes away because
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.590 align:start position:0%
water access problem goes away because
you can just use desalination. We have
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
you can just use desalination. We have
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
you can just use desalination. We have
the technology, it's just too expensive.
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
the technology, it's just too expensive.
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.350 align:start position:0%
the technology, it's just too expensive.
So, only, you know, fairly wealthy
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
So, only, you know, fairly wealthy
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.510 align:start position:0%
So, only, you know, fairly wealthy
countries like Singapore and Israel and
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
countries like Singapore and Israel and
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.990 align:start position:0%
countries like Singapore and Israel and
so on like actually use it. But but if
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
so on like actually use it. But but if
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.990 align:start position:0%
so on like actually use it. But but if
it was uh cheap then every then you know
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
it was uh cheap then every then you know
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
it was uh cheap then every then you know
all countries that have a coast could
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
all countries that have a coast could
01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.950 align:start position:0%
all countries that have a coast could
but also you'd have unlimited rocket
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
but also you'd have unlimited rocket
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.110 align:start position:0%
but also you'd have unlimited rocket
fuel. You could just separate sea water
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
fuel. You could just separate sea water
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.110 align:start position:0%
fuel. You could just separate sea water
out into hydrogen and oxygen using
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
out into hydrogen and oxygen using
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.630 align:start position:0%
out into hydrogen and oxygen using
energy and that's rocket fuel. So uh
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
energy and that's rocket fuel. So uh
01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.709 align:start position:0%
energy and that's rocket fuel. So uh
combined with you know Elon's amazing
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
combined with you know Elon's amazing
01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:03.270 align:start position:0%
combined with you know Elon's amazing
self landing rockets then it could be
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
self landing rockets then it could be
01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.110 align:start position:0%
self landing rockets then it could be
like you sort of like a bus service to
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
like you sort of like a bus service to
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.510 align:start position:0%
like you sort of like a bus service to
to space. So that opens up you know
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
to space. So that opens up you know
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.709 align:start position:0%
to space. So that opens up you know
incredible new resources and domains. uh
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
incredible new resources and domains. uh
01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
incredible new resources and domains. uh
asteroid mining I think will become a
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
asteroid mining I think will become a
01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.390 align:start position:0%
asteroid mining I think will become a
thing and maximum human flourishing to
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
thing and maximum human flourishing to
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
thing and maximum human flourishing to
the stars. That's what I uh dream about
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
the stars. That's what I uh dream about
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.630 align:start position:0%
the stars. That's what I uh dream about
as well is like Carl Sean's sort of idea
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
as well is like Carl Sean's sort of idea
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.390 align:start position:0%
as well is like Carl Sean's sort of idea
of bringing consciousness to the
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
of bringing consciousness to the
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.630 align:start position:0%
of bringing consciousness to the
universe, waking up the universe. And I
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
universe, waking up the universe. And I
01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
universe, waking up the universe. And I
I think human civilization will do that
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
I think human civilization will do that
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.790 align:start position:0%
I think human civilization will do that
in the full sense of time if we get AI
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
in the full sense of time if we get AI
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
in the full sense of time if we get AI
right and uh and and and crack some of
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
right and uh and and and crack some of
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
right and uh and and and crack some of
these problems with it.
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
these problems with it.
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
these problems with it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I wonder what it would look like
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I wonder what it would look like
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.149 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I wonder what it would look like
if you just a tourist flying through
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
if you just a tourist flying through
01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
if you just a tourist flying through
space. You would probably notice Earth
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
space. You would probably notice Earth
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.430 align:start position:0%
space. You would probably notice Earth
because if you solve the energy problem,
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
because if you solve the energy problem,
01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
because if you solve the energy problem,
you would see a lot of space rockets
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
you would see a lot of space rockets
01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
you would see a lot of space rockets
probably. So it would be like traffic
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably. So it would be like traffic
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.189 align:start position:0%
probably. So it would be like traffic
here in London.
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
here in London.
01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
here in London.
&gt;&gt; But in space,
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But in space,
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.310 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But in space,
&gt;&gt; just a lot of rockets
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; just a lot of rockets
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; just a lot of rockets
&gt;&gt; and then you would probably see floating
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and then you would probably see floating
01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.110 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and then you would probably see floating
in space some kind of source of energy
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
in space some kind of source of energy
01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:53.990 align:start position:0%
in space some kind of source of energy
like solar.
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
like solar.
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.470 align:start position:0%
like solar.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.030 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Potentially. So earth would just look
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Potentially. So earth would just look
01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Potentially. So earth would just look
more on the surface more um
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
more on the surface more um
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
more on the surface more um

and then then you would use the power of
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then then you would use the power of
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.430 align:start position:0%
and then then you would use the power of
that energy then to preserve the natural
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
that energy then to preserve the natural
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
that energy then to preserve the natural
&gt;&gt; yes
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yes
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yes
&gt;&gt; like the rainforest and all that kind of
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; like the rainforest and all that kind of
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; like the rainforest and all that kind of
stuff
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
stuff
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
stuff
&gt;&gt; because for the first time in in human
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; because for the first time in in human
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; because for the first time in in human
history we wouldn't be uh resource
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
history we wouldn't be uh resource
01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
history we wouldn't be uh resource
constrainted and I think that could be
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%

amazing new era for humanity where it's
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
amazing new era for humanity where it's
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.110 align:start position:0%

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
not zero sum right I have this land you
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.270 align:start position:0%
not zero sum right I have this land you
don't have it or if we take you know if

01:15:43.679 --> 01:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; the way about physics, about the way the
world works, about sometimes you lose,
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
world works, about sometimes you lose,
01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
world works, about sometimes you lose,
sometimes you win. You can still be
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes you win. You can still be
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.110 align:start position:0%
sometimes you win. You can still be
friends with everybody. But that that
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
friends with everybody. But that that
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.790 align:start position:0%
friends with everybody. But that that
feeling of losing, I mean, it's a weird
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
feeling of losing, I mean, it's a weird
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
feeling of losing, I mean, it's a weird
one for us humans to like really like
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
one for us humans to like really like
01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
one for us humans to like really like
make sense of like that's just part of
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
make sense of like that's just part of
01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.189 align:start position:0%
make sense of like that's just part of
life. That is a fundamental part of life
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
life. That is a fundamental part of life
01:15:59.199 --> 01:16:00.070 align:start position:0%
life. That is a fundamental part of life
is losing.
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
is losing.
01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.830 align:start position:0%
is losing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think in martial arts as I
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think in martial arts as I
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think in martial arts as I
understand it, but also in things like
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
understand it, but also in things like
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
understand it, but also in things like
light chess is a at least the way I took
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
light chess is a at least the way I took
01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.310 align:start position:0%
light chess is a at least the way I took
it, it's a lot to do with
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
it, it's a lot to do with
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
it, it's a lot to do with
self-improvement, self-nowledge. You
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
self-improvement, self-nowledge. You
01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.510 align:start position:0%
self-improvement, self-nowledge. You
know that, okay, so I did this thing.
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
know that, okay, so I did this thing.
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
know that, okay, so I did this thing.
It's not about really being the other
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
It's not about really being the other
01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
It's not about really being the other
person. It's about maximizing your own
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
person. It's about maximizing your own
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.189 align:start position:0%
person. It's about maximizing your own
potential. If you do it in a healthy
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
potential. If you do it in a healthy
01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:20.149 align:start position:0%
potential. If you do it in a healthy
way, you learn to use victory and losses
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
way, you learn to use victory and losses
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.669 align:start position:0%
way, you learn to use victory and losses
in a way. Don't get carried away with
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
in a way. Don't get carried away with
01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
in a way. Don't get carried away with
victory and and think you're the just
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
victory and and think you're the just
01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.669 align:start position:0%
victory and and think you're the just
the best in the world. Keep and and and
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
the best in the world. Keep and and and
01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:27.750 align:start position:0%
the best in the world. Keep and and and
the losses keep you humble and always
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
the losses keep you humble and always
01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.189 align:start position:0%
the losses keep you humble and always
knowing there's always something more to
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
knowing there's always something more to
01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:30.950 align:start position:0%
knowing there's always something more to
learn. there's always a bigger expert
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
learn. there's always a bigger expert
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.870 align:start position:0%
learn. there's always a bigger expert
that you can mentor you, you know, I
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
that you can mentor you, you know, I
01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.630 align:start position:0%
that you can mentor you, you know, I
think you learn that I'm pretty sure in
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
think you learn that I'm pretty sure in
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.950 align:start position:0%
think you learn that I'm pretty sure in
martial arts and and and I think that's
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
martial arts and and and I think that's
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.950 align:start position:0%
martial arts and and and I think that's
also uh the way that at least I was
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
also uh the way that at least I was
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.510 align:start position:0%
also uh the way that at least I was
trained in chess. And so in the same way
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
trained in chess. And so in the same way
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.950 align:start position:0%
trained in chess. And so in the same way
and it can be very hardcore and very
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it can be very hardcore and very
01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.470 align:start position:0%
and it can be very hardcore and very
important and of course you want to win,
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
important and of course you want to win,
01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.229 align:start position:0%
important and of course you want to win,
but you also need to learn how to deal
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
but you also need to learn how to deal
01:16:46.239 --> 01:16:49.030 align:start position:0%
but you also need to learn how to deal
with setbacks in a in a healthy way that
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
with setbacks in a in a healthy way that
01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
with setbacks in a in a healthy way that
and and and and wire that that feeling
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
and and and and wire that that feeling
01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.030 align:start position:0%
and and and and wire that that feeling
that you have when you lose something
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
that you have when you lose something
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.189 align:start position:0%
that you have when you lose something
into a constructive thing of next time
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
into a constructive thing of next time
01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
into a constructive thing of next time
I'm going to improve this, right? Or get
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to improve this, right? Or get
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
I'm going to improve this, right? Or get
better at this. There is something
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
better at this. There is something
01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.630 align:start position:0%
better at this. There is something
that's a source of happiness, a source
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's a source of happiness, a source
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.709 align:start position:0%
that's a source of happiness, a source
of meaning, that improvement step. It's
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
of meaning, that improvement step. It's
01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:04.070 align:start position:0%
of meaning, that improvement step. It's
not about the winning or losing.
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
not about the winning or losing.
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.070 align:start position:0%
not about the winning or losing.
&gt;&gt; Yes. The mastery. There's nothing more
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. The mastery. There's nothing more
01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. The mastery. There's nothing more
satisfying in a way is like, "Oh, wow.
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
satisfying in a way is like, "Oh, wow.
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.070 align:start position:0%

This thing I couldn't do before, now I
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
This thing I couldn't do before, now I
01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.550 align:start position:0%
This thing I couldn't do before, now I
can." And and and again, games and
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
can." And and and again, games and
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.310 align:start position:0%

physical sports and and mental sports,
they're way they're ways of measuring.
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're way they're ways of measuring.
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.189 align:start position:0%
they're way they're ways of measuring.
They're beautiful because you can
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
They're beautiful because you can
01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
They're beautiful because you can
measure that that progress.
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
measure that that progress.
01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.950 align:start position:0%
measure that that progress.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean there's something about
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean there's something about
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.310 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean there's something about
this is why I love role playing games
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is why I love role playing games
01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.430 align:start position:0%
this is why I love role playing games
like the uh number go up of like my on
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
like the uh number go up of like my on
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.669 align:start position:0%
like the uh number go up of like my on
the skill tree like literally that is a
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
the skill tree like literally that is a
01:17:27.679 --> 01:17:29.270 align:start position:0%
the skill tree like literally that is a
source of meaning for us humans whatever
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
source of meaning for us humans whatever
01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:29.669 align:start position:0%
source of meaning for us humans whatever
our
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
our
01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:31.270 align:start position:0%
our
&gt;&gt; yeah we're quite we're quite addicted to
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yeah we're quite we're quite addicted to
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.590 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yeah we're quite we're quite addicted to
this sort of yeah these numbers going up
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
this sort of yeah these numbers going up
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.229 align:start position:0%
this sort of yeah these numbers going up
and uh and and and and maybe that's why
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
and uh and and and and maybe that's why
01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
and uh and and and and maybe that's why
we made games like that because
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
we made games like that because
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.430 align:start position:0%
we made games like that because
obviously that is something we're we're
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
obviously that is something we're we're
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.910 align:start position:0%
obviously that is something we're we're
hill climbing systems ourselves right
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
hill climbing systems ourselves right
01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
hill climbing systems ourselves right
&gt;&gt; yeah it would be quite sad if we didn't
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yeah it would be quite sad if we didn't
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.669 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yeah it would be quite sad if we didn't
have any mechanism by
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
have any mechanism by
01:17:45.679 --> 01:17:47.669 align:start position:0%
have any mechanism by
&gt;&gt; color belts all of the we do we do this
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; color belts all of the we do we do this
01:17:47.679 --> 01:17:49.350 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; color belts all of the we do we do this
everywhere right where we just have this
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere right where we just have this
01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.310 align:start position:0%
everywhere right where we just have this
thing that
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
thing that
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
thing that
&gt;&gt; it's and I don't want to dismiss that
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; it's and I don't want to dismiss that
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; it's and I don't want to dismiss that
that there is a source of deep meaning
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
that there is a source of deep meaning
01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.910 align:start position:0%
that there is a source of deep meaning
for us as humans. U so one of the
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
for us as humans. U so one of the
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
for us as humans. U so one of the
incredible stories on the business on
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
incredible stories on the business on
01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.390 align:start position:0%
incredible stories on the business on
the leadership side is um what Google
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
the leadership side is um what Google
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.390 align:start position:0%
the leadership side is um what Google
has done over the past year. So I uh I
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
has done over the past year. So I uh I
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.229 align:start position:0%
has done over the past year. So I uh I
think it's fair to say that Google was
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
think it's fair to say that Google was
01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
think it's fair to say that Google was
losing on the LLM product side uh a year
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
losing on the LLM product side uh a year
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
losing on the LLM product side uh a year
ago with Gemini 15 and now it's winning
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
ago with Gemini 15 and now it's winning
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
ago with Gemini 15 and now it's winning
with Gemini 25 and you took the helm and
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
with Gemini 25 and you took the helm and
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.709 align:start position:0%
with Gemini 25 and you took the helm and
you led this effort. What did it take to

course, you have, you know, we have a
01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.550 align:start position:0%
course, you have, you know, we have a
lot of great compute as well. But then
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
lot of great compute as well. But then
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.709 align:start position:0%
lot of great compute as well. But then
it's the research culture we've created,
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
it's the research culture we've created,
01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:45.430 align:start position:0%
it's the research culture we've created,
right? and basically coming together

right? and basically coming together
01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.430 align:start position:0%
right? and basically coming together
both different groups in in Google you
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
both different groups in in Google you
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.030 align:start position:0%
both different groups in in Google you
know there was Google brain world-class
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
know there was Google brain world-class
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.590 align:start position:0%

earlier the same thing that's useful in
01:23:52.639 --> 01:23:55.189 align:start position:0%
earlier the same thing that's useful in
science um I think is is can also be
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
science um I think is is can also be
01:23:55.199 --> 01:23:58.950 align:start position:0%
science um I think is is can also be
useful in in product design. And um I
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
useful in in product design. And um I
01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.629 align:start position:0%
useful in in product design. And um I
I've just had a very you know always
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
I've just had a very you know always
01:24:00.639 --> 01:24:02.550 align:start position:0%
I've just had a very you know always
been a sort of multi-disiplinary person.
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
been a sort of multi-disiplinary person.
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.950 align:start position:0%
been a sort of multi-disiplinary person.
So I don't see uh the boundaries really
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
So I don't see uh the boundaries really
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.830 align:start position:0%
So I don't see uh the boundaries really
between you know arts and sciences or
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
between you know arts and sciences or
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.669 align:start position:0%
between you know arts and sciences or
product and research. It's it's a
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
product and research. It's it's a
01:24:09.679 --> 01:24:11.430 align:start position:0%
product and research. It's it's a
continuum for me. I mean I only work on
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
continuum for me. I mean I only work on
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.709 align:start position:0%
continuum for me. I mean I only work on
I like working on products that are
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
I like working on products that are
01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:14.070 align:start position:0%
I like working on products that are
cutting edge. I wouldn't be able to you
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
cutting edge. I wouldn't be able to you
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.750 align:start position:0%
cutting edge. I wouldn't be able to you
know have cutting edge technology under
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
know have cutting edge technology under
01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.350 align:start position:0%
know have cutting edge technology under
the hood. I wouldn't be excited about
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
the hood. I wouldn't be excited about
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.950 align:start position:0%

them if they were just run-of-the-mill
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.350 align:start position:0%
them if they were just run-of-the-mill
products. Um so it requires this
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
products. Um so it requires this
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
products. Um so it requires this
invention creativity capability. What
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%

are some specific things you kind of
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.550 align:start position:0%
are some specific things you kind of

&gt;&gt; maybe the trade-off between the latency,
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; maybe the trade-off between the latency,
01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; maybe the trade-off between the latency,
like how
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
like how
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.830 align:start position:0%
like how
&gt;&gt; how to present to the user how long to
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; how to present to the user how long to
01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; how to present to the user how long to

reasoning capabilities. There's some
01:24:46.639 --> 01:24:47.990 align:start position:0%

interesting things cuz like you said,
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
interesting things cuz like you said,
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.270 align:start position:0%
interesting things cuz like you said,
it's the very cutting edge. We don't
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's the very cutting edge. We don't
01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.229 align:start position:0%
it's the very cutting edge. We don't
know
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
know
01:24:50.239 --> 01:24:52.310 align:start position:0%
know
&gt;&gt; how to present it, how to present it
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; how to present it, how to present it
01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; how to present it, how to present it
correctly. So is there some specific
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
correctly. So is there some specific
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.189 align:start position:0%

things you've you've learned?
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
things you've you've learned?
01:24:55.199 --> 01:24:57.430 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; I mean it's such a fast evolving space.
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I mean it's such a fast evolving space.
01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I mean it's such a fast evolving space.

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
know, you look at 2.5 versus 1.5 and
01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.470 align:start position:0%
know, you look at 2.5 versus 1.5 and
it's just a gigantic improvement. And we
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a gigantic improvement. And we
01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.910 align:start position:0%
it's just a gigantic improvement. And we

we'll look back on today's interfaces
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
we'll look back on today's interfaces

GTA 6? The world waits for both. And
01:28:56.239 --> 01:29:00.470 align:start position:0%
GTA 6? The world waits for both. And
what does it take to go from 25
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
what does it take to go from 25
01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.270 align:start position:0%
what does it take to go from 25
to 3 0? Because it seems like there's
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
to 3 0? Because it seems like there's
01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.350 align:start position:0%
to 3 0? Because it seems like there's
been a lot of releases of 25 which are
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
been a lot of releases of 25 which are
01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.350 align:start position:0%
been a lot of releases of 25 which are
already leaps in performance.
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
already leaps in performance.
01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.189 align:start position:0%
already leaps in performance.
&gt;&gt; So what what does it even mean to go to
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So what what does it even mean to go to
01:29:09.199 --> 01:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So what what does it even mean to go to
a new version? Is it about performance?
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
a new version? Is it about performance?
01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.229 align:start position:0%
a new version? Is it about performance?
Is this about a completely different

Is this about a completely different
01:29:14.239 --> 01:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
Is this about a completely different
flavor of an experience?
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
flavor of an experience?
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.229 align:start position:0%
flavor of an experience?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, so the way it works with our
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, so the way it works with our
01:29:18.239 --> 01:29:21.350 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, so the way it works with our
different uh version numbers is we you
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
different uh version numbers is we you
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.510 align:start position:0%
different uh version numbers is we you
know we try to collect so maybe it takes
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
know we try to collect so maybe it takes
01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.669 align:start position:0%
know we try to collect so maybe it takes
you know roughly 6 months or something
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know roughly 6 months or something
01:29:25.679 --> 01:29:28.870 align:start position:0%
you know roughly 6 months or something
to to do a new kind of full run and the
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
to to do a new kind of full run and the
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.709 align:start position:0%
to to do a new kind of full run and the
full productization of a new version and
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
full productization of a new version and
01:29:32.719 --> 01:29:34.709 align:start position:0%
full productization of a new version and
during that time lots of new interesting
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
during that time lots of new interesting
01:29:34.719 --> 01:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
during that time lots of new interesting
research iterations and ideas come up
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
research iterations and ideas come up
01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
research iterations and ideas come up
and we sort of collect them all together
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we sort of collect them all together
01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.870 align:start position:0%
and we sort of collect them all together
that you know you could imagine the last
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
that you know you could imagine the last
01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.590 align:start position:0%
that you know you could imagine the last
6 months worth of interesting ideas on
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
6 months worth of interesting ideas on
01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.990 align:start position:0%
6 months worth of interesting ideas on
the architecture front uh maybe it's on
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
the architecture front uh maybe it's on
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.830 align:start position:0%
the architecture front uh maybe it's on
on the data front. It's like many
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
on the data front. It's like many
01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.070 align:start position:0%
on the data front. It's like many
different possible things and we collect
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
different possible things and we collect
01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.790 align:start position:0%
different possible things and we collect
package that all up, test which ones are
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
package that all up, test which ones are
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.390 align:start position:0%
package that all up, test which ones are
likely to be useful for the next
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
likely to be useful for the next
01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.390 align:start position:0%
likely to be useful for the next
iteration and then bundle that all
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
iteration and then bundle that all
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.629 align:start position:0%
iteration and then bundle that all
together and then we start the new you
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
together and then we start the new you
01:29:58.639 --> 01:30:00.950 align:start position:0%
together and then we start the new you
know giant hero training run right and
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
know giant hero training run right and
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.270 align:start position:0%
know giant hero training run right and
and then uh and then of course that gets
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then of course that gets
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.270 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then of course that gets
monitored uh and then at the end then
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
monitored uh and then at the end then
01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.790 align:start position:0%
monitored uh and then at the end then
there's the of the pre-training then
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
there's the of the pre-training then
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.070 align:start position:0%
there's the of the pre-training then
there's all the post- training there's
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's all the post- training there's
01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.189 align:start position:0%
there's all the post- training there's
many different ways of doing that
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
many different ways of doing that
01:30:09.199 --> 01:30:10.790 align:start position:0%
many different ways of doing that
different ways of patching it so there's
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
different ways of patching it so there's
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.629 align:start position:0%
different ways of patching it so there's
a whole experimental phase there which
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
a whole experimental phase there which
01:30:12.639 --> 01:30:14.470 align:start position:0%
a whole experimental phase there which
you can also get a lot of gains out and
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
you can also get a lot of gains out and
01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.390 align:start position:0%
you can also get a lot of gains out and
that's where you see the version numbers
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's where you see the version numbers
01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.229 align:start position:0%
that's where you see the version numbers

architecture. And then of course on top
01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.510 align:start position:0%

of that, we also have different sizes,
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
of that, we also have different sizes,
01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.990 align:start position:0%
of that, we also have different sizes,
pro and flash and flashlight that are
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
pro and flash and flashlight that are
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.750 align:start position:0%

often distilled from the biggest ones,
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
often distilled from the biggest ones,

you know, the flash model from the Pro
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know, the flash model from the Pro
01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.470 align:start position:0%
you know, the flash model from the Pro
model. And that means we have a range of
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
model. And that means we have a range of
01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.790 align:start position:0%
model. And that means we have a range of
different choices if you are the
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
different choices if you are the
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
different choices if you are the
developer of do you want to prioritize
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
developer of do you want to prioritize
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:52.390 align:start position:0%

performance or speed right and cost. And
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
performance or speed right and cost. And
01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.790 align:start position:0%
performance or speed right and cost. And
we like to think of this parto frontier
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
we like to think of this parto frontier
01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.030 align:start position:0%
we like to think of this parto frontier
of of you know on the one hand uh the y-
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
of of you know on the one hand uh the y-
01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.110 align:start position:0%
of of you know on the one hand uh the y-
axis is you know like performance and
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
axis is you know like performance and
01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.669 align:start position:0%
axis is you know like performance and
then the the the x-axis is you know cost
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
then the the the x-axis is you know cost
01:31:01.679 --> 01:31:04.470 align:start position:0%
then the the the x-axis is you know cost
or latency and and speed uh basically
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
or latency and and speed uh basically
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.709 align:start position:0%

and we we have models that completely
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
and we we have models that completely
01:31:06.719 --> 01:31:09.669 align:start position:0%
and we we have models that completely
define the frontier. So whatever your
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
define the frontier. So whatever your
01:31:09.679 --> 01:31:11.189 align:start position:0%
define the frontier. So whatever your
trade-off is that you want as an
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
trade-off is that you want as an
01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.910 align:start position:0%
trade-off is that you want as an
individual user or as a as a developer,
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
individual user or as a as a developer,
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.510 align:start position:0%
individual user or as a as a developer,
you should find one of our models
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
you should find one of our models
01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:17.430 align:start position:0%
you should find one of our models
satisfies that constraint.
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
satisfies that constraint.
01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.669 align:start position:0%
satisfies that constraint.
&gt;&gt; So behind the version changes, there is
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So behind the version changes, there is
01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:21.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So behind the version changes, there is
a big hero run.
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
a big hero run.
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:21.669 align:start position:0%
a big hero run.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
01:31:21.679 --> 01:31:25.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And then there's uh just an insane
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And then there's uh just an insane
01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And then there's uh just an insane
complexity of productization.
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
complexity of productization.
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
complexity of productization.
Then there's the distillation of the
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
Then there's the distillation of the
01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.189 align:start position:0%
Then there's the distillation of the
different sizes along that predator
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
different sizes along that predator
01:31:33.199 --> 01:31:36.149 align:start position:0%
different sizes along that predator
front. And then as with each step you
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
front. And then as with each step you
01:31:36.159 --> 01:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
front. And then as with each step you
take, you realize there might be a cool
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
take, you realize there might be a cool
01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.750 align:start position:0%
take, you realize there might be a cool
product. There's side quests.
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
product. There's side quests.
01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.390 align:start position:0%
product. There's side quests.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.229 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; But and then you also don't want to take
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But and then you also don't want to take
01:31:42.239 --> 01:31:43.830 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But and then you also don't want to take
too many side quests because then you
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
too many side quests because then you
01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.189 align:start position:0%
too many side quests because then you
have a million versions of million
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
have a million versions of million
01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:47.830 align:start position:0%
have a million versions of million
products. It's very unclear, but you

also get super excited because it's
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
also get super excited because it's
01:31:49.199 --> 01:31:51.270 align:start position:0%
also get super excited because it's

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
from the post training and and even
further downstream than that you you
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
further downstream than that you you
01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.550 align:start position:0%
further downstream than that you you
kind of upstream that into the the core
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
kind of upstream that into the the core
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.390 align:start position:0%
kind of upstream that into the the core
model training for the next run. Right.
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
model training for the next run. Right.
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.709 align:start position:0%

So then the main model the main Gemini
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
So then the main model the main Gemini
01:32:14.719 --> 01:32:16.870 align:start position:0%
So then the main model the main Gemini
track becomes more and more general and
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
track becomes more and more general and
01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.149 align:start position:0%
track becomes more and more general and
eventually you know AGI
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
eventually you know AGI
01:32:20.159 --> 01:32:21.270 align:start position:0%
eventually you know AGI

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; one hero run at a time.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. A few hero runs later.
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. A few hero runs later.
01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. A few hero runs later.
&gt;&gt; Uh yeah. So sometimes when you release
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Uh yeah. So sometimes when you release
01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.709 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Uh yeah. So sometimes when you release
these new versions or every version

01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
measure the usefulness but it's so hard
01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.510 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; um to balance and because you can't

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then other things that are

people. They have very interesting
01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.830 align:start position:0%
people. They have very interesting
characters many of them as you might
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
characters many of them as you might
01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.149 align:start position:0%
characters many of them as you might
expect. Um, but yeah, I'm on good terms.
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
expect. Um, but yeah, I'm on good terms.
01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
expect. Um, but yeah, I'm on good terms.
I I hope with pretty much all of them.
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
I I hope with pretty much all of them.
01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.070 align:start position:0%
I I hope with pretty much all of them.
And uh I I think that's going to be
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
And uh I I think that's going to be
01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.550 align:start position:0%
And uh I I think that's going to be
important when when things get even more
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
important when when things get even more
01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.709 align:start position:0%
important when when things get even more
serious than they are now. Uh that there
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
serious than they are now. Uh that there
01:37:50.719 --> 01:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
serious than they are now. Uh that there
are those communication channels and uh
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
are those communication channels and uh
01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
are those communication channels and uh
that's what will facilitate uh
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's what will facilitate uh
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.590 align:start position:0%
that's what will facilitate uh
cooperation or collaboration if that's
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
cooperation or collaboration if that's
01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.669 align:start position:0%
cooperation or collaboration if that's
what is required especially on things
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
what is required especially on things
01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:00.550 align:start position:0%
what is required especially on things
like safety.
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
like safety.
01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
like safety.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hope there's some collaboration
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hope there's some collaboration
01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.709 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hope there's some collaboration
on stuff that's uh sort of less high
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
on stuff that's uh sort of less high
01:38:04.719 --> 01:38:07.590 align:start position:0%
on stuff that's uh sort of less high
stakes and in so doing serves as a
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
stakes and in so doing serves as a
01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.030 align:start position:0%
stakes and in so doing serves as a
mechanism for maintaining friendships
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism for maintaining friendships
01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.870 align:start position:0%
mechanism for maintaining friendships
and relationships. So, for example, I
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
and relationships. So, for example, I
01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.310 align:start position:0%
and relationships. So, for example, I
think the internet would love it if you
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
think the internet would love it if you
01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.990 align:start position:0%
think the internet would love it if you
and Elon somehow collaborated on
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
and Elon somehow collaborated on
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.350 align:start position:0%
and Elon somehow collaborated on
creating a video game. That kind of
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
creating a video game. That kind of
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.830 align:start position:0%
creating a video game. That kind of
thing that I think that enables
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
thing that I think that enables
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:20.550 align:start position:0%
thing that I think that enables
camaraderie in good terms and also you
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
camaraderie in good terms and also you
01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.310 align:start position:0%
camaraderie in good terms and also you
two are legit gamers. So, it's just fun
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
two are legit gamers. So, it's just fun
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.030 align:start position:0%
two are legit gamers. So, it's just fun
to Yeah.
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
to Yeah.
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:23.590 align:start position:0%
to Yeah.
&gt;&gt; fun to create.
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; fun to create.
01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.709 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; fun to create.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be awesome. And we've
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be awesome. And we've
01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:26.149 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be awesome. And we've
talked about that in the past and it may
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
talked about that in the past and it may
01:38:26.159 --> 01:38:27.750 align:start position:0%
talked about that in the past and it may
be a cool thing that that you know we
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
be a cool thing that that you know we
01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.109 align:start position:0%
be a cool thing that that you know we
can do. And I agree with you. It'd be
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
can do. And I agree with you. It'd be
01:38:29.119 --> 01:38:32.470 align:start position:0%
can do. And I agree with you. It'd be
nice to have um kind of side projects in
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
nice to have um kind of side projects in
01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.750 align:start position:0%
nice to have um kind of side projects in
a way where where one can just lean into
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
a way where where one can just lean into
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.590 align:start position:0%
a way where where one can just lean into
the collaboration aspect of it and it's
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
the collaboration aspect of it and it's
01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.470 align:start position:0%
the collaboration aspect of it and it's
a sort of uh win-win for both sides and
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
a sort of uh win-win for both sides and
01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
a sort of uh win-win for both sides and
it's um and it kind of builds up that
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's um and it kind of builds up that
01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
it's um and it kind of builds up that
that that uh collaborative muscle.
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
that that uh collaborative muscle.
01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.950 align:start position:0%
that that uh collaborative muscle.
&gt;&gt; I see the scientific endeavor as that
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I see the scientific endeavor as that
01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.830 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I see the scientific endeavor as that
kind of side project for humanity and I
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
kind of side project for humanity and I
01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.750 align:start position:0%

I think deep Google deep mind has been
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
I think deep Google deep mind has been
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:54.229 align:start position:0%
I think deep Google deep mind has been
really pushing that. I would love it if
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
really pushing that. I would love it if
01:38:54.239 --> 01:38:56.709 align:start position:0%
really pushing that. I would love it if
to see other labs do more scientific
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
to see other labs do more scientific
01:38:56.719 --> 01:38:58.470 align:start position:0%
to see other labs do more scientific
stuff and then collaborate cuz it just
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
stuff and then collaborate cuz it just
01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.149 align:start position:0%
stuff and then collaborate cuz it just
seems like easier to collaborate on the
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
seems like easier to collaborate on the
01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:02.390 align:start position:0%
seems like easier to collaborate on the
big scientific questions. I agree and I
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
big scientific questions. I agree and I
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
big scientific questions. I agree and I
would love to see a lot of people a lot
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
would love to see a lot of people a lot
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.430 align:start position:0%
would love to see a lot of people a lot
of the other labs talk about science but
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the other labs talk about science but
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
of the other labs talk about science but
I think we're really the only ones using
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
I think we're really the only ones using
01:39:07.199 --> 01:39:09.030 align:start position:0%
I think we're really the only ones using
it for science and doing that and that's
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
it for science and doing that and that's
01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.950 align:start position:0%

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
know, there's a strategy that that Meta
is taking right now. I think that um
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
is taking right now. I think that um
01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.430 align:start position:0%

from my perspective at least I think the

know it's probably rational what they're

know it's probably rational what they're
01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.709 align:start position:0%
know it's probably rational what they're

doing from their perspective because
01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.070 align:start position:0%
doing from their perspective because
they're behind and they need to do
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're behind and they need to do
01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.470 align:start position:0%
they're behind and they need to do
something but I think um there's more
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
something but I think um there's more
01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.070 align:start position:0%
something but I think um there's more
important things than than just money.
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
important things than than just money.
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.910 align:start position:0%

01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.669 align:start position:0%

but as pro and and and I was expecting

but as pro and and and I was expecting

what I've always known for 30 plus years
now which is that AGI is the most

now which is that AGI is the most
01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.470 align:start position:0%
now which is that AGI is the most

01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
important technology probably that's
01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.149 align:start position:0%
important technology probably that's
ever going to be invented. So in some
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
ever going to be invented. So in some
01:41:24.159 --> 01:41:26.149 align:start position:0%
ever going to be invented. So in some
senses it's it's rational to be doing
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
senses it's it's rational to be doing
01:41:26.159 --> 01:41:28.470 align:start position:0%
senses it's it's rational to be doing
that. But I also think there's a much

that. But I also think there's a much
01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.229 align:start position:0%
that. But I also think there's a much
bigger question. I mean people in AI
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
bigger question. I mean people in AI
01:41:30.239 --> 01:41:32.550 align:start position:0%

these days are very well paid. You know
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
these days are very well paid. You know
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.470 align:start position:0%
these days are very well paid. You know
I I remember when we were starting out
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
I I remember when we were starting out
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.310 align:start position:0%
I I remember when we were starting out
back in 2010 you know I didn't even pay
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 you know I didn't even pay
01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:37.990 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 you know I didn't even pay
myself for a couple of years because
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
myself for a couple of years because
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.270 align:start position:0%
myself for a couple of years because
wasn't enough money. We couldn't raise
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough money. We couldn't raise
01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.189 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough money. We couldn't raise
any money. And these days interns are
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
any money. And these days interns are
01:41:41.199 --> 01:41:43.030 align:start position:0%
any money. And these days interns are
being paid you know the amount that we
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
being paid you know the amount that we
01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.590 align:start position:0%

raised as our first entire seed round.
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
raised as our first entire seed round.
01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.109 align:start position:0%

So it's pretty funny. And I remember the

So it's pretty funny. And I remember the
01:41:47.119 --> 01:41:48.950 align:start position:0%
So it's pretty funny. And I remember the
days where we used I used to have to to
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
days where we used I used to have to to
01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
days where we used I used to have to to
work for free and and almost pay my own
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.629 align:start position:0%

all the other way around but that's just

all the other way around but that's just
01:41:54.159 --> 01:41:57.109 align:start position:0%

01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
and it's again counterintuitive to what
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.910 align:start position:0%
and it's again counterintuitive to what
we thought years ago maybe that some of
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
we thought years ago maybe that some of
01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.229 align:start position:0%
we thought years ago maybe that some of
the skills that we think of as harder
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
the skills that we think of as harder
01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:08.229 align:start position:0%
the skills that we think of as harder
skills are turned out maybe to be the
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
skills are turned out maybe to be the
01:43:08.239 --> 01:43:10.070 align:start position:0%
skills are turned out maybe to be the
easier ones for various reasons but you
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
easier ones for various reasons but you
01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.669 align:start position:0%
easier ones for various reasons but you
know coding and math because you can
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
know coding and math because you can
01:43:11.679 --> 01:43:13.350 align:start position:0%
know coding and math because you can
create a lot of synthetic data and
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
create a lot of synthetic data and
01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.669 align:start position:0%
create a lot of synthetic data and
verify if that data is correct. So
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
verify if that data is correct. So
01:43:15.679 --> 01:43:16.950 align:start position:0%
verify if that data is correct. So
because of that nature of that it's
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
because of that nature of that it's
01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.790 align:start position:0%
because of that nature of that it's
easier to make things like synthetic
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
easier to make things like synthetic
01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
easier to make things like synthetic
data to train from. Um it's also an area
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
data to train from. Um it's also an area
01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.390 align:start position:0%
data to train from. Um it's also an area
of course we're all interested in
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
of course we're all interested in
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.870 align:start position:0%
of course we're all interested in
because as programmers right to help us
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
because as programmers right to help us
01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
because as programmers right to help us
and get faster at it and more
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
and get faster at it and more
01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.470 align:start position:0%
and get faster at it and more
productive. So I think the for the next
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
productive. So I think the for the next
01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.709 align:start position:0%
productive. So I think the for the next
era like the next 5 10 years I think
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
era like the next 5 10 years I think
01:43:30.719 --> 01:43:32.709 align:start position:0%
era like the next 5 10 years I think
what we're going to find is people who
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
what we're going to find is people who
01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:35.430 align:start position:0%
what we're going to find is people who
are kind of embrace these technologies
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
are kind of embrace these technologies
01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.669 align:start position:0%
are kind of embrace these technologies
become almost at one with them um
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
become almost at one with them um
01:43:37.679 --> 01:43:38.790 align:start position:0%
become almost at one with them um
whether that's in the creative
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
whether that's in the creative
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.550 align:start position:0%
whether that's in the creative
industries or the technical industries
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
industries or the technical industries
01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.470 align:start position:0%
industries or the technical industries
will become sort of superhumanly
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
will become sort of superhumanly
01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:44.390 align:start position:0%
will become sort of superhumanly
productive I think. So the great
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
productive I think. So the great
01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.750 align:start position:0%
productive I think. So the great
programmers will be even better but
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
programmers will be even better but
01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.270 align:start position:0%
programmers will be even better but
they'll be even 10x even what they are
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be even 10x even what they are
01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.189 align:start position:0%
they'll be even 10x even what they are
today and because there you'll be able
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
today and because there you'll be able
01:43:49.199 --> 01:43:51.590 align:start position:0%
today and because there you'll be able
to use their skills to utilize the the
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
to use their skills to utilize the the
01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.109 align:start position:0%
to use their skills to utilize the the
tools to the maximum uh you exploit them
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
tools to the maximum uh you exploit them
01:43:55.119 --> 01:43:57.590 align:start position:0%
tools to the maximum uh you exploit them
to the maximum and um so I think that's
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the maximum and um so I think that's
01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
to the maximum and um so I think that's
what we're going to see in the next
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
what we're going to see in the next
01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.030 align:start position:0%
what we're going to see in the next
domain um so that's going to cause quite
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
domain um so that's going to cause quite
01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.189 align:start position:0%
domain um so that's going to cause quite
a lot of change right and so that's
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of change right and so that's
01:44:03.199 --> 01:44:05.189 align:start position:0%
a lot of change right and so that's
coming a lot of people benefit from that
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
coming a lot of people benefit from that
01:44:05.199 --> 01:44:07.750 align:start position:0%
coming a lot of people benefit from that
so I think one example of that is if
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
so I think one example of that is if
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:10.470 align:start position:0%
so I think one example of that is if
coding becomes easier um it becomes
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
coding becomes easier um it becomes
01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:12.629 align:start position:0%
coding becomes easier um it becomes
available to many more creatives to do
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
available to many more creatives to do
01:44:12.639 --> 01:44:15.350 align:start position:0%
available to many more creatives to do
more uh and uh but I think the top
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
more uh and uh but I think the top
01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.189 align:start position:0%
more uh and uh but I think the top
programmers will still have huge
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
programmers will still have huge
01:44:17.199 --> 01:44:19.350 align:start position:0%
programmers will still have huge
advantages as terms of specifying going
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
advantages as terms of specifying going
01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.430 align:start position:0%
advantages as terms of specifying going
back to specifying what the architecture
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
back to specifying what the architecture
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:23.430 align:start position:0%
back to specifying what the architecture
should be the question should be how to
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
should be the question should be how to
01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
should be the question should be how to
guide these um uh coding assistants in a
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
guide these um uh coding assistants in a
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.629 align:start position:0%
guide these um uh coding assistants in a
way that's useful and you know check
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
way that's useful and you know check
01:44:28.639 --> 01:44:31.030 align:start position:0%
way that's useful and you know check
whether the code they produce is good so
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
whether the code they produce is good so
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.229 align:start position:0%
whether the code they produce is good so
I think there's plenty of um uh headroom
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
I think there's plenty of um uh headroom
01:44:34.239 --> 01:44:36.070 align:start position:0%
I think there's plenty of um uh headroom
there for the foreseeable you know next
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
there for the foreseeable you know next
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:36.629 align:start position:0%
there for the foreseeable you know next
few years
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
few years
01:44:36.639 --> 01:44:38.149 align:start position:0%
few years
&gt;&gt; so I think there's there's several
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; so I think there's there's several
01:44:38.159 --> 01:44:40.390 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; so I think there's there's several
interesting things there one is there's
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
interesting things there one is there's
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.709 align:start position:0%
interesting things there one is there's
a lot of imperative to just get better
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of imperative to just get better
01:44:42.719 --> 01:44:44.390 align:start position:0%
a lot of imperative to just get better
and better consistently of using these
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
and better consistently of using these
01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
and better consistently of using these
tools. So they they're riding the wave
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
tools. So they they're riding the wave
01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.870 align:start position:0%
tools. So they they're riding the wave
of the improvement improving models.
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the improvement improving models.
01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
of the improvement improving models.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Versus like competing against them.
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Versus like competing against them.
01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Versus like competing against them.
&gt;&gt; But sadly, but that's the the nature of
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But sadly, but that's the the nature of
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.629 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But sadly, but that's the the nature of
of life on earth. Um there could be a
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
of life on earth. Um there could be a
01:44:58.639 --> 01:45:00.310 align:start position:0%
of life on earth. Um there could be a
huge amount of value to certain kinds of
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
huge amount of value to certain kinds of
01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.950 align:start position:0%
huge amount of value to certain kinds of
programming at the cutting edge and less
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
programming at the cutting edge and less
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.830 align:start position:0%
programming at the cutting edge and less
value to other kinds. For example, it
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
value to other kinds. For example, it
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.470 align:start position:0%
value to other kinds. For example, it
could be like, you know, front end
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
could be like, you know, front end
01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.790 align:start position:0%

01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be one of those eras where there will
01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.109 align:start position:0%
to be one of those eras where there will
be a lot of change I think there'll be
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
be a lot of change I think there'll be
01:45:55.119 --> 01:45:57.030 align:start position:0%
be a lot of change I think there'll be
new jobs we can't even imagine today
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
new jobs we can't even imagine today
01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.189 align:start position:0%
new jobs we can't even imagine today
just like the internet created and then
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
just like the internet created and then
01:45:59.199 --> 01:46:00.870 align:start position:0%
just like the internet created and then
those people with the right skill sets
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
those people with the right skill sets
01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.709 align:start position:0%
those people with the right skill sets
to ride that wave will become incredibly
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
to ride that wave will become incredibly
01:46:04.719 --> 01:46:07.109 align:start position:0%
to ride that wave will become incredibly
uh valuable right those skills but maybe
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh valuable right those skills but maybe
01:46:07.119 --> 01:46:09.430 align:start position:0%
uh valuable right those skills but maybe
people will have to relearn or adapt a
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
people will have to relearn or adapt a
01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.229 align:start position:0%
people will have to relearn or adapt a
bit uh their current skills. And it's
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
bit uh their current skills. And it's
01:46:12.239 --> 01:46:13.990 align:start position:0%
bit uh their current skills. And it's
the the thing that's going to be harder
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
the the thing that's going to be harder
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.990 align:start position:0%
the the thing that's going to be harder
to deal with this time around is that I
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with this time around is that I
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.189 align:start position:0%
to deal with this time around is that I
think what we're going to see is
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
think what we're going to see is
01:46:17.199 --> 01:46:19.830 align:start position:0%
think what we're going to see is
something like probably 10 times the
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
something like probably 10 times the
01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.990 align:start position:0%
something like probably 10 times the
impact the industrial revolution had and
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
impact the industrial revolution had and
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.790 align:start position:0%
impact the industrial revolution had and
but 10 times faster as well. Right? So
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
but 10 times faster as well. Right? So
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.109 align:start position:0%
but 10 times faster as well. Right? So
instead of 100 years, it takes 10 years.
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
instead of 100 years, it takes 10 years.
01:46:27.119 --> 01:46:28.229 align:start position:0%
instead of 100 years, it takes 10 years.
And so that's going to make it, you
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
And so that's going to make it, you
01:46:28.239 --> 01:46:30.550 align:start position:0%
And so that's going to make it, you
know, it's like a 100x uh the impact and
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
know, it's like a 100x uh the impact and
01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.109 align:start position:0%
know, it's like a 100x uh the impact and
the speed combined. So that's what's I
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
the speed combined. So that's what's I
01:46:33.119 --> 01:46:34.550 align:start position:0%
the speed combined. So that's what's I
think going to make it more difficult
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
think going to make it more difficult
01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:37.830 align:start position:0%
think going to make it more difficult
for society to to to deal with and it's
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
for society to to to deal with and it's
01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.510 align:start position:0%
for society to to to deal with and it's
there's a lot to think through and I
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to think through and I
01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.350 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to think through and I
think we need to be discussing that
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
think we need to be discussing that
01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.189 align:start position:0%
think we need to be discussing that
right now and I I you know I encourage

01:46:43.199 --> 01:46:44.870 align:start position:0%

philosophy and political science is
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
philosophy and political science is
01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:32.310 align:start position:0%
philosophy and political science is
going to be key uh to that. But I think
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
going to be key uh to that. But I think
01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.629 align:start position:0%
going to be key uh to that. But I think
the number one thing first of all is to
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
the number one thing first of all is to
01:48:34.639 --> 01:48:38.149 align:start position:0%
the number one thing first of all is to
create more abundance of resources right
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
create more abundance of resources right
01:48:38.159 --> 01:48:39.590 align:start position:0%
create more abundance of resources right
then there's the so that's the number
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
then there's the so that's the number
01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.070 align:start position:0%
then there's the so that's the number
one thing increase productivity get more
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
one thing increase productivity get more
01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.910 align:start position:0%
one thing increase productivity get more
resources maybe eventually get out of

resources maybe eventually get out of
01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.470 align:start position:0%
resources maybe eventually get out of
the zero sum situation then the second
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
the zero sum situation then the second
01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:48.629 align:start position:0%
the zero sum situation then the second
question is how to use uh those
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
question is how to use uh those
01:48:48.639 --> 01:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
question is how to use uh those
resources and distribute those resources
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
resources and distribute those resources
01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.310 align:start position:0%
resources and distribute those resources
but yeah you can't do that without
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
but yeah you can't do that without
01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.870 align:start position:0%

01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
human and uh I think it's very important
01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.070 align:start position:0%
human and uh I think it's very important
though that we remember that as when
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
though that we remember that as when
01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.470 align:start position:0%
though that we remember that as when
we're immersed in the technology and the
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're immersed in the technology and the
01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.550 align:start position:0%
we're immersed in the technology and the
the research I think a lot of
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
the research I think a lot of
01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:05.189 align:start position:0%
the research I think a lot of
researchers that I see in in our field
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
researchers that I see in in our field
01:55:05.199 --> 01:55:07.910 align:start position:0%
researchers that I see in in our field
are a little bit too narrow and only
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
are a little bit too narrow and only
01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:09.750 align:start position:0%
are a little bit too narrow and only
understand the technology and I think
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
understand the technology and I think
01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.350 align:start position:0%
understand the technology and I think
also that's why it's important important
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
also that's why it's important important
01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.149 align:start position:0%
also that's why it's important important
for this to be debated by society at

for this to be debated by society at
01:55:14.159 --> 01:55:15.990 align:start position:0%
for this to be debated by society at

like this the AI summits that will
01:55:17.599 --> 01:55:19.510 align:start position:0%
like this the AI summits that will
happen and governments understanding it

and I think that's one good thing about
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that's one good thing about
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:23.189 align:start position:0%
and I think that's one good thing about
the chatbot era and the product era of

the chatbot era and the product era of
01:55:23.199 --> 01:55:25.669 align:start position:0%
the chatbot era and the product era of
AI is that everyday person can actually

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Because they they force the
01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:33.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Because they they force the

able to adapt to these technologies like
01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.510 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Do you think there will be something
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Do you think there will be something
01:56:12.159 --> 01:56:16.149 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Do you think there will be something
like a Manhattan project
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
like a Manhattan project
01:56:16.159 --> 01:56:17.990 align:start position:0%
like a Manhattan project
where
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
where
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.510 align:start position:0%
where
um there will be an escalation of the
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
um there will be an escalation of the
01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:21.510 align:start position:0%
um there will be an escalation of the
power of this technology and states in
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
power of this technology and states in
01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:23.350 align:start position:0%
power of this technology and states in
their old way of thinking will try to
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
their old way of thinking will try to
01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.189 align:start position:0%
their old way of thinking will try to
use it as weapons technologies and there
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
use it as weapons technologies and there
01:56:25.199 --> 01:56:27.270 align:start position:0%
use it as weapons technologies and there
will be this kind of escalation.
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
will be this kind of escalation.
01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:30.709 align:start position:0%
will be this kind of escalation.
&gt;&gt; I hope not. Um I think that would be uh
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I hope not. Um I think that would be uh
01:56:30.719 --> 01:56:35.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I hope not. Um I think that would be uh
very dangerous to do and I think also um
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
very dangerous to do and I think also um
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.629 align:start position:0%
very dangerous to do and I think also um
you know not the right use of the
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
you know not the right use of the
01:56:36.639 --> 01:56:38.709 align:start position:0%
you know not the right use of the
technology. I I hope we'll end up with
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
technology. I I hope we'll end up with
01:56:38.719 --> 01:56:40.550 align:start position:0%
technology. I I hope we'll end up with
more something more collaborative if
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
more something more collaborative if
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.350 align:start position:0%
more something more collaborative if
needed like more like a like a CERN
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
needed like more like a like a CERN
01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:46.790 align:start position:0%
needed like more like a like a CERN
project you know where um it's research
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
project you know where um it's research
01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:49.510 align:start position:0%
project you know where um it's research
focused and the best minds in the world
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
focused and the best minds in the world
01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
focused and the best minds in the world
come together to carefully complete the
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
come together to carefully complete the
01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.790 align:start position:0%
come together to carefully complete the
final steps and make sure it's
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
final steps and make sure it's
01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:57.350 align:start position:0%
final steps and make sure it's
responsibly done before you know like
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
responsibly done before you know like
01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.669 align:start position:0%
responsibly done before you know like
deploying it to the world. We'll see. I
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
deploying it to the world. We'll see. I
01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:00.950 align:start position:0%
deploying it to the world. We'll see. I
mean it's difficult with the current
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
mean it's difficult with the current
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
mean it's difficult with the current
geopolitical climate I think uh to to
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
geopolitical climate I think uh to to
01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:06.390 align:start position:0%
geopolitical climate I think uh to to
see cooperation but things can change
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
see cooperation but things can change
01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
see cooperation but things can change
and um I think at least on the
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
and um I think at least on the
01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:10.229 align:start position:0%
and um I think at least on the
scientific level it's important for the
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
scientific level it's important for the
01:57:10.239 --> 01:57:12.709 align:start position:0%
scientific level it's important for the
researchers to to to to keep in touch
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
researchers to to to to keep in touch
01:57:12.719 --> 01:57:15.030 align:start position:0%
researchers to to to to keep in touch
and and and keep close to each other on
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
and and and keep close to each other on
01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.790 align:start position:0%
and and and keep close to each other on
at least on those kinds of topics.
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
at least on those kinds of topics.
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.310 align:start position:0%
at least on those kinds of topics.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I I personally believe on the
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I I personally believe on the
01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.109 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I I personally believe on the
education side and um immigration side,
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
education side and um immigration side,
01:57:21.119 --> 01:57:23.830 align:start position:0%
education side and um immigration side,
it would be great if both directions uh
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
it would be great if both directions uh
01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.149 align:start position:0%
it would be great if both directions uh
people from the west immigrated to China
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
people from the west immigrated to China
01:57:26.159 --> 01:57:28.390 align:start position:0%
people from the west immigrated to China
and China back. I mean there is some
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
and China back. I mean there is some
01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:31.350 align:start position:0%
and China back. I mean there is some
like family human aspect of people just
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
like family human aspect of people just
01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:32.310 align:start position:0%
like family human aspect of people just
intermixing.
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
intermixing.
01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:32.709 align:start position:0%
intermixing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
01:57:32.719 --> 01:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And thereby those ties grow strong. So
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And thereby those ties grow strong. So
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.030 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And thereby those ties grow strong. So
you can't sort of divide against each
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
you can't sort of divide against each
01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:38.870 align:start position:0%
you can't sort of divide against each
other this kind of old school way of
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
other this kind of old school way of
01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:41.990 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Science has always been uh I think
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Science has always been uh I think
01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:59.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Science has always been uh I think
quite a a very collaborative endeavor
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
quite a a very collaborative endeavor
01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:01.510 align:start position:0%
quite a a very collaborative endeavor
and you know scientists know that it's
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
and you know scientists know that it's
01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.350 align:start position:0%
and you know scientists know that it's
it's a it's a collective endeavor as

it's a it's a collective endeavor as

to get a bit of cooperation. What's your
uh ridiculous question? What's your

&gt;&gt; Well, look, I I don't have a
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Well, look, I I don't have a
01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:19.589 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Well, look, I I don't have a
it's a you know, I don't have a pdoom
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's a you know, I don't have a pdoom
01:58:19.599 --> 01:58:22.070 align:start position:0%
it's a you know, I don't have a pdoom
number. The reason I don't is because I
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
number. The reason I don't is because I
01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.390 align:start position:0%
number. The reason I don't is because I
think it's would imply a level of
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
think it's would imply a level of
01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
think it's would imply a level of
precision that is not there. So, like I
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
precision that is not there. So, like I
01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.390 align:start position:0%
precision that is not there. So, like I
don't know how people are getting their
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
don't know how people are getting their
01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.310 align:start position:0%
don't know how people are getting their
poom numbers. I think it's a kind of a
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
poom numbers. I think it's a kind of a
01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.149 align:start position:0%
poom numbers. I think it's a kind of a
little bit of a ridiculous notion
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
little bit of a ridiculous notion
01:58:32.159 --> 01:58:35.189 align:start position:0%
little bit of a ridiculous notion
because um what I would say is it's
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
because um what I would say is it's
01:58:35.199 --> 01:58:37.750 align:start position:0%
because um what I would say is it's
definitely nonzero and it's probably non
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
definitely nonzero and it's probably non
01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:40.950 align:start position:0%
definitely nonzero and it's probably non
negligible. So that in itself is pretty
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
negligible. So that in itself is pretty
01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:43.589 align:start position:0%
negligible. So that in itself is pretty
sobering and my my view is it's just
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
sobering and my my view is it's just
01:58:43.599 --> 01:58:45.910 align:start position:0%
sobering and my my view is it's just
hugely uncertain, right? What these
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
hugely uncertain, right? What these
01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:47.589 align:start position:0%
hugely uncertain, right? What these
technologies are going to be able to do,
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
technologies are going to be able to do,
01:58:47.599 --> 01:58:49.510 align:start position:0%
technologies are going to be able to do,
how fast are they going to take off, how
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
how fast are they going to take off, how
01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.109 align:start position:0%
how fast are they going to take off, how
controllable they going to be. Some
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
controllable they going to be. Some
01:58:51.119 --> 01:58:53.350 align:start position:0%
controllable they going to be. Some
things may turn out to be and hopefully
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
things may turn out to be and hopefully
01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.510 align:start position:0%
things may turn out to be and hopefully
like way easier than we thought, right?
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
like way easier than we thought, right?
01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:57.510 align:start position:0%
like way easier than we thought, right?
Um but it may be there's some really
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
Um but it may be there's some really
01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:00.390 align:start position:0%
Um but it may be there's some really
hard um uh uh problems that are harder
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
hard um uh uh problems that are harder
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.030 align:start position:0%
hard um uh uh problems that are harder
than we guess today and I think uh we
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
than we guess today and I think uh we
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.430 align:start position:0%
than we guess today and I think uh we
don't know that for sure and so in under
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that for sure and so in under
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.510 align:start position:0%
don't know that for sure and so in under
those conditions of a lot of uncertainty
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
those conditions of a lot of uncertainty
01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.910 align:start position:0%

with cautious optimism. So we want the

of course uh and uh all of the the

amazing things that AI can bring and
01:59:39.599 --> 01:59:41.589 align:start position:0%

actually I would be really worried for

actually I would be really worried for
01:59:41.599 --> 01:59:44.070 align:start position:0%

didn't know something like AI was coming
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know something like AI was coming
01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.350 align:start position:0%
didn't know something like AI was coming
down the line right how would we solve
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
down the line right how would we solve
01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:55.109 align:start position:0%
down the line right how would we solve
all those other problems I think it's
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
all those other problems I think it's
01:59:55.119 --> 01:59:57.510 align:start position:0%
all those other problems I think it's
hard um so I think we've you know it
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
hard um so I think we've you know it
01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:59.109 align:start position:0%
hard um so I think we've you know it
could be amazingly transformative for
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
could be amazingly transformative for
01:59:59.119 --> 02:00:02.229 align:start position:0%
could be amazingly transformative for
good um but on the other And you know
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
good um but on the other And you know
02:00:02.239 --> 02:00:03.990 align:start position:0%
good um but on the other And you know
there are these risks that we know are
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are these risks that we know are
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.870 align:start position:0%
there are these risks that we know are
there but we can't quite quantify. So
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
there but we can't quite quantify. So
02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.390 align:start position:0%
there but we can't quite quantify. So
the the best thing to do is to use the
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the best thing to do is to use the
02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:11.669 align:start position:0%
the the best thing to do is to use the
scientific method to do more research to
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
scientific method to do more research to
02:00:11.679 --> 02:00:15.350 align:start position:0%
scientific method to do more research to
try and uh more precisely define those
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
try and uh more precisely define those
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
try and uh more precisely define those
risks and of course address them. Um and
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
risks and of course address them. Um and
02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:19.990 align:start position:0%
risks and of course address them. Um and
I think that's what we're doing. I think
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we're doing. I think
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.229 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we're doing. I think
there probably needs to be uh 10 times
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
there probably needs to be uh 10 times
02:00:22.239 --> 02:00:24.790 align:start position:0%
there probably needs to be uh 10 times
more effort on that than there is now as
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
more effort on that than there is now as
02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
more effort on that than there is now as
we're getting closer and closer to the

we're getting closer and closer to the
02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:28.149 align:start position:0%
we're getting closer and closer to the

02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
to the to the AGI line.
02:00:28.159 --> 02:00:29.510 align:start position:0%
to the to the AGI line.

captured very well in the in the
02:03:36.239 --> 02:03:39.189 align:start position:0%
captured very well in the in the
documentary about it and um I think
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
documentary about it and um I think
02:03:39.199 --> 02:03:41.270 align:start position:0%
documentary about it and um I think
that'll continue in many domains where
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
that'll continue in many domains where
02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.030 align:start position:0%
that'll continue in many domains where
there's this at least for the for the

questions we can ask ourselves is what
02:04:04.159 --> 02:04:07.350 align:start position:0%
questions we can ask ourselves is what
makes humans special? It does feel I'm
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
makes humans special? It does feel I'm
02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:10.629 align:start position:0%
makes humans special? It does feel I'm
perhaps biased that we humans are deeply

and starting on this journey of like um
02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:28.229 align:start position:0%

one can kind of philosophize about it
02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.629 align:start position:0%
one can kind of philosophize about it
and have thought experiments and maybe
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
and have thought experiments and maybe
02:04:42.639 --> 02:04:44.470 align:start position:0%
and have thought experiments and maybe
even do actual experiments like you do
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
even do actual experiments like you do
02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.430 align:start position:0%
even do actual experiments like you do
in neuroscience on on real brains but in

in neuroscience on on real brains but in

the end I always imagined that building
02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:51.990 align:start position:0%

AI a kind intelligent artifact and then
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
AI a kind intelligent artifact and then
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.589 align:start position:0%

comparing that to the human mind and
02:04:53.599 --> 02:04:55.750 align:start position:0%
comparing that to the human mind and
seeing what the differences were uh
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
seeing what the differences were uh
02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:57.589 align:start position:0%
seeing what the differences were uh
would be the best way to uncover what's
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to uncover what's
02:04:57.599 --> 02:04:59.589 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to uncover what's

there is anything special and I suspect
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
there is anything special and I suspect
02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
there is anything special and I suspect
there probably is but it's going to be

there probably is but it's going to be
02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.950 align:start position:0%
there probably is but it's going to be

02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
helpful scientific explanation. I think
02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:27.830 align:start position:0%

it's kind of interesting intuition in
02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.950 align:start position:0%
it's kind of interesting intuition in

they, to my knowledge, they haven't

found anything um convincing yet. So my

maybe that will tell us. Uh so I think
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
maybe that will tell us. Uh so I think
02:07:35.119 --> 02:07:37.030 align:start position:0%

it's it's going to be interesting. I had

it's it's going to be interesting. I had

are conscious? Okay, so it's for two
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
are conscious? Okay, so it's for two
02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
are conscious? Okay, so it's for two
reasons. One is you're exhibiting the
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
reasons. One is you're exhibiting the
02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:46.709 align:start position:0%
reasons. One is you're exhibiting the
same behavior that I am. So that's one
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
same behavior that I am. So that's one
02:07:46.719 --> 02:07:48.470 align:start position:0%
same behavior that I am. So that's one
thing. behaviorally you seem like a
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
thing. behaviorally you seem like a
02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.390 align:start position:0%
thing. behaviorally you seem like a
conscious being if I am. But the second
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
conscious being if I am. But the second
02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.069 align:start position:0%
conscious being if I am. But the second
thing which is often overlooked is that
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
thing which is often overlooked is that
02:07:52.079 --> 02:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
thing which is often overlooked is that
we're running on the same substrate. So
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're running on the same substrate. So
02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
we're running on the same substrate. So
if you're behaving in the same way and
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
if you're behaving in the same way and
02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.950 align:start position:0%
if you're behaving in the same way and
we're running on the same substrate,
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're running on the same substrate,
02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.870 align:start position:0%
we're running on the same substrate,
it's most parsimonious to assume you're
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's most parsimonious to assume you're
02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:00.790 align:start position:0%
it's most parsimonious to assume you're
feeling the same experience that I'm
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
feeling the same experience that I'm
02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:04.069 align:start position:0%
feeling the same experience that I'm
feeling. But with an AI uh that's on
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%

02:08:04.079 --> 02:08:06.069 align:start position:0%

silicon, we won't be able to rely on the
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
silicon, we won't be able to rely on the
02:08:06.079 --> 02:08:07.669 align:start position:0%
silicon, we won't be able to rely on the
second part. Even if it exhibits the
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
second part. Even if it exhibits the
02:08:07.679 --> 02:08:09.270 align:start position:0%
second part. Even if it exhibits the
first part, the behavior looks like a
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
first part, the behavior looks like a
02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:10.629 align:start position:0%
first part, the behavior looks like a
behavior of a conscious being. It might
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
behavior of a conscious being. It might
02:08:10.639 --> 02:08:14.069 align:start position:0%
behavior of a conscious being. It might
even claim it is. Um but we but but we
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
even claim it is. Um but we but but we
02:08:14.079 --> 02:08:16.870 align:start position:0%
