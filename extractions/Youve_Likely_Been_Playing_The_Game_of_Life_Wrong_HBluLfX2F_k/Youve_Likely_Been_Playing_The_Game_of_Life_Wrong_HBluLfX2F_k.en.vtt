00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.060
- Some things are not normal.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.100
By that I mean if you go out in the world

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.250
and start measuring things
like human height, IQ,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.410
or the size of apples on a tree.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.810
You will find that for
each of these things,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.410
most of the data clusters
around some average value.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
This is so common that we call
it the normal distribution,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.180
but some things in life are not like this.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.060
- Nature shows power
laws all over the place.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.050
That seems weird.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.750
Like, is nature tuning
itself to criticality?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.240
- If you make a crude measure
of how big is the world war

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.890
by how many people it kills,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.110
you find that it follows a power law.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.110
The outcome will vary in size
over 10 million, 100 million.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.210
- It's much more likelihood
of really big events

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.370
than you would expect from
a normal distribution,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.680
and they will totally skew the average.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.080
- The system you're
looking at doesn't have

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.390
any inherent physical scale.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.250
It's really hard to know
what's gonna happen next.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.580
- The more you measure,
the bigger the average is,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.650
which is really weird,
it sounds impossible.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.530
- It's very important to try to understand

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.090
which game you're playing

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.153
and what are the payoffs
going to be in the long run.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.890
- In the late 1800s, Italian
engineer Vilfredo Pareto

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.130
stumbled upon something
no one had seen before.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.860
See, he suspected there
might be a hidden pattern

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.840
in how much money people make.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.520
So he gathered income tax records

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.820
from Italy, England, France,
and other European countries,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
and for each country he plotted
the distribution of income.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.200
Each country he looked at,
he saw the same pattern,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.490
a pattern which still holds
in most countries to this day,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.370
and it's not a normal distribution.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.830
If you think about a normal
distribution like height,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.840
there's a clearly defined average

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.900
and extreme outliers
basically never happen.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.640
I mean, you are never
going to find someone

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.370
who is, say, five times
the average height,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.260
that would be physically impossible,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.990
but Pareto's income
distributions were different.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.520
Take this curve for England,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.900
it shows the number of people

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.120
who earn more than a certain income.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.340
The curve starts off declining steeply,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.530
most people earn relatively little,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.690
but then it falls away gradually,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.600
much more slowly than a
normal distribution would,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.810
and it spans several orders of magnitude.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.270
There were people who
earned 5 times, 10 times,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.150
even 100 times more than others.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.830
That kind of spread just wouldn't happen

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.633
if income were normally distributed.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.170
Now to shrink this huge spread of data,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.990
Pareto calculated the
logarithms of all the values

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.760
and plotted those instead.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.340
In other words, he used a log-log plot,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.360
and when he did that,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.870
the broad curve transformed
into a straight line.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.810
The gradient was around negative 1.5.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.270
That means each time
you double the income,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.730
say, from 200 pounds to 400 pounds,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.160
the number of people
earning at least that amount

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.580
drops off by a factor of
two to the power of 1.5,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.290
which is around 2.8.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.560
And this pattern holds for
every doubling of income.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.020
So Pareto could describe
the distribution of incomes

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.940
with one simple equation.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.460
The number of people who
earn an income greater than

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.520
or equal to X is
proportional to one over X

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.573
to the power of 1.5.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.020
Now, that's what Pareto saw for England,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.230
but he performed the same
analysis on data from Italy,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.960
France, Prussia, and a
bunch of other countries,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.410
and he saw the same thing again and again.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.010
Each time the data transformed
into a straight line

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.650
and the gradients were remarkably similar.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.500
That meant Pareto could
describe the income distribution

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.440
in each country with the same equation,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.140
one over the income to some power,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.930
where that power is just
the absolute gradient

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.060
of the logarithmic graph.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.690
This type of relationship
is called a power law.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.120
When you move from the world
of normal distributions

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.620
to the world of power laws,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.570
things change dramatically.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.620
So to illustrate this,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.270
let's take a trip to the casino

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.180
to play three different games.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.200
At table number one, you
get 100 tosses of a coin.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.460
Each time you flip and it
lands on heads, you win $1.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.540
So the question is,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.960
how much would you be prepared
to pay to play this game?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.010
Well, we need to work out

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.960
how much you'd expect to win in this game

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.600
and then pay less than
that expected value.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.780
So the probability of
throwing a head is 1/2.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.350
Multiply that by $1 and
multiply that by 100 tosses,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.050
that gives you an expected payout of $50.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.520
So you should be willing to pay

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.160
anything less than $50 to play this game.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.110
Sure, you might not win every time,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.750
but if you play the
game hundreds of times,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.700
the small variations
either side of the average

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.090
will cancel out and you can
expect to turn a profit.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.160
One of the first people to
study this kind of problem

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.190
was Abraham de Moivre in the early 1700s.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.770
He showed that if you plot the
probability of each outcome,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.480
you get a bell-shaped curve,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.690
which was later coined
the normal distribution.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.830
- Normal distributions,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.180
the traditional explanation

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.970
is that when there are a lot
of effects that are random

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.050
that are adding up,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.090
that's when you expect normals.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.510
So like how tall I am depends
on a lot of random things,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.300
about my nutrition, about
my parents' genetics,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.170
all kinds of things,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.650
but if these random effects are additive,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.400
that is what tends to lead to normals.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.520
- At table number two, there's
a slightly different game.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.220
You still get 100 tosses of the coin,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.053
but this time,

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:23.850
instead of potentially
winning a dollar on each flip,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.850
your winnings are
multiplied by some factor.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.160
So you start out with $1,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.230
and then every time you toss a head,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.080
you multiply your winnings by 1.1.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.240
If instead the coin lands on tails,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.730
you multiply your winnings by 0.9.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.170
And after 100 tosses,

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.760
you take home the total,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.500
that is the dollar you started with

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.573
times the string of 1.1s and 0.9s.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.830
So, how much should you
pay to play this game?

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.120
Well, on each flip,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.730
your payout can either grow or shrink,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.120
and each is equally likely
each time you toss the coin,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.130
so the expected factor each turn

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.850
is just 1.1 plus 0.9 divided
by two, which is one.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.130
So if you start out with $1,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.190
then your expected payout is just $1.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.780
That means you should be willing to pay

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.170
anything less than a dollar
to play this game, right?

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.630
Well, if you look at the
distribution of payouts,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.730
you can see that you could win big.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.440
If you tossed 100 heads,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.810
you'd win 1.1 to the power of 100.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.480
That's almost $14,000,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.860
although the chance of that happening

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.990
is around 1 in 10 to the power of 30.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.550
You'd be more likely to win the lottery

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.870
three times in a row.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.410
On the other hand, the median
payout is around 61 cents.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.810
So if you're only
playing the game one time

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.660
and you want even odds
of turning a profit,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.660
well, then you should
pay less than 61 cents.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.270
Though either way, if you played
the game hundreds of times,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.383
your payout would average out to $1.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.460
Now, watch what happens
if we switch the x-axis

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.010
from a linear scale to
a logarithmic scale.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.960
Well, then you see the curve transforms

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.730
into a normal distribution.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.530
That's why this type of distribution

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.050
is called a log normal distribution.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.000
- When random effects multiply,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.340
if I have a certain wealth

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.400
and then my wealth goes up by
a certain percentage next year

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.140
because of my investments,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.190
and then the year after that,

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.220
it changes by another random factor,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.430
as opposed to adding, I'm
multiplying year after year.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.980
If you have a big product
of random numbers,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.630
when you take the log of a product,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.253
that's the sum of the logs.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.520
So what was a product of random numbers

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.170
then gets translated into sums
of logs of random numbers,

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.003
and that's what leads

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:34.380
to this so-called log normal distribution.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.340
And log normal distributions
produce big inequalities.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.560
You don't just see a mean,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.810
you see a mean with a big long tail.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.780
It's much more likelihood
of really big events,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.750
in this case, tremendous
wealth being obtained,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.810
than you would expect from
a normal distribution.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.790
- The reason this curve is so asymmetric

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.280
is because the downside is capped at zero,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.813
so at most, you could lose $1,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.733
but the upside can keep
growing up to nearly $14,000.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.730
Now let's go on to table three.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.410
Again, you'll be tossing a coin,

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.570
but this time you start out with a dollar

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.660
and the payout doubles
each time you toss the coin

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.660
and you keep tossing
until you get a heads,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.190
then the game ends.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.610
So if you get heads on your
first toss, you get $2.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.050
If you get a tails first

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.200
and then hit a heads on your
second toss, you get $4.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.120
If you flipped two tails and then a head,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.270
on your third toss,
you'd get $8, and so on.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.700
If it took you to the
nth toss to get a heads,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.430
you would get two to the n dollars.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.970
So, how much should you
pay to play this game?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.530
Well, as in our previous example,

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.750
we need to work out the expected value.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.390
So suppose you throw a
head on your first try,

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.710
the payout is $2

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.380
and the probability of
that outcome is a half,

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.770
so the expected value of
that toss is a dollar.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.990
If it takes you two tosses to get a heads,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.580
then the payout is $4

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.430
and the probability of that
happening is one over four,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.280
so again, the expected value is $1.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.870
We also need to add in the chance

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.550
that you flip heads on your third try,

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.620
in that case, the payout is $8

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.350
and the probability of that
happening is one over eight,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.283
so again, the expected value is $1.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.720
And we have to keep
repeating this calculation

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.880
over all possible outcomes.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.700
We have to keep adding $1 for
each of the different options

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.550
for flipping the coin, say, 10
times until it lands on heads

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.010
or 100 times before you get heads.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.050
I know it's extremely unlikely,

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.640
but the payout is so huge

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.300
that the expected value of
that outcome is still a dollar,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.140
so it still increases the
expected value of the whole game.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.150
This means that, theoretically,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.053
the total expected value
of this game is infinite.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.220
This is known as the
St. Petersburg paradox.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.440
If you look at the
distribution of payouts,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.330
you can see it's uncapped,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.850
it spans across all orders of magnitude.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.970
You could get a payout
of $1,000, $100,000,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.190
or even a million dollars or more.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.890
And while a million
dollar payout is unlikely,

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.480
it's not that unlikely,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.163
it's around one in a million.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.940
Now, if you transform
both axes to a log scale,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.420
you see a straight line with
a gradient of negative one.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.580
The payout of the St. Petersburg paradox

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.260
follows a power law.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.090
The specific power law in this case

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.190
is that the probability of a payout x

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.330
is equal to x to the power of
negative one or one over x.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.760
In the previous games when
you have a normal distribution

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.740
or even a log normal distribution,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.140
you can measure the width
of that distribution,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.970
its standard deviation.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.380
And in a normal distribution,

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.590
95% of the data fall within
two standard deviations

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.670
from the mean.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.820
But with a power law, like in
the St. Petersburg paradox,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.950
there is no measurable width,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.890
the standard deviation is infinite.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.130
This makes power laws a
fundamentally different beast

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.770
with some very weird properties.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.810
- Imagine you take a
bunch of random samples

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.980
and then average them

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.590
and then take more random
samples and average them,

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.470
you'll find that the
average keeps going up,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.240
it doesn't converge.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.320
And the more you measure,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.900
the bigger the average is,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.390
which is really weird,
it sounds impossible,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.150
but it's because it has such a heavy tail,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.480
meaning the probability of
really whopping big events

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.360
is so significant that
if you keep measuring,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.530
occasionally you're gonna measure

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.420
one of those extreme outliers

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.780
and they will totally skew the average.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.460
It's sort of like saying,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.240
if you're standing in a room
with Bill Gates or Elon Musk,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.820
the average wealth in that room

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.960
is gonna be 100 billion
dollars or something (laughs)

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.990
because the average is
dominated by one outlier.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.140
- And that same idea, one
outlier can dominate the average,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.030
shows up online too.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.070
A handful of companies, servers,

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.470
and data centers hold
the personal information

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.790
of millions of people,

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.110
so when one of them gets hacked,

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.873
it can have ripple effects
across the whole network.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.950
We've had scammers get a
hold of email addresses

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.140
and phone numbers of writers on our team

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.140
and then send them messages
pretending to be me.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.170
That is where today's
sponsor, NordVPN, comes in.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.270
NordVPN encrypts your internet traffic

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.190
so your personal data stays private,

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.290
even when the wider system isn't.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.120
It protects you from hackers, trackers,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.920
and malware with threat protection,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.380
even when you're not connected to a VPN.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.740
Within just 15 minutes of
registering a new email,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.500
we saw that five leaks
had already been detected.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.560
NordVPN lets you browse securely

I'll put the link down in the description.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.550
I'd like to thank NordVPN
for sponsoring this video.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.413
And now, back to power laws.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.440
So, why do you get a power law

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.573
from the simple St. Petersburg setup?

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.870
If you look at the payout x,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.790
you can see it grows exponentially

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.590
with each toss of the coin,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.540
x equals two to the n.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.330
But if you look at the
probability of tossing the coin

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.160
that many times to get a heads,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.670
you can see that this probability
shrinks exponentially.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.100
So the probability of
flipping a coin n times

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.260
is 1/2 to the power of n.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.720
But we're not really interested
in the number of tosses,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.400
we're interested in the payout.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.530
Now we know that x equals two to the n,

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.970
so instead of writing two to the n

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.230
in our probability equation,

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.940
we can just write x.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.617
So we end up with this,

00:13:34.617 --> 00:13:36.870
the probability of a payout of x dollars

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.700
is equal to one over x,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.390
or in other words, x to
the power of negative one.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.250
- You put them together,

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.310
the exponentials conspire
to make a power law.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.440
And that's a very common thing in nature,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.330
that a lot of times
when we see power laws,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.700
there are two underlying exponentials

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.540
that are dancing together
to make a power law.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.790
- One example of this is earthquakes.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.260
If you look at data on earthquakes,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.990
you find that small
earthquakes are very common,

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.330
but earthquakes of increasing magnitudes

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.090
become exponentially rarer.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.860
But the destruction that earthquakes cause

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.870
is not proportional to their magnitude,

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.270
it's proportional to
the energy they release.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.490
And as earthquakes grow in magnitude,

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.010
that energy grows exponentially.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.600
- So there's this exponential decay

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.900
in frequency of earthquakes
of a given magnitude

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.610
and an exponential increase in
the amount of energy released

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.770
by earthquakes of a certain magnitude.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.620
So when you combine those two exponentials

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.060
to eliminate the magnitude,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.670
what you find is a power law.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.860
- But power laws also
reveal something deeper

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.230
about the underlying
structure of a system.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.370
To see this in action,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.040
let's go back to the third coin game

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.510
and the St. Petersburg paradox.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.430
Now, you can draw all
the different outcomes

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.630
as a tree diagram

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.780
where the length of each branch
is equal to its probability.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.850
So starting with a
single line of length one

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.040
and then 1/2 for the first two branches,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.440
1/4 for the next four, and so on.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.120
Now, when you zoom in,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.490
you keep seeing the
same structure repeating

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.440
at smaller and smaller scales.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.020
It's self-similar like a fractal,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.000
and that's no coincidence.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.120
We see the same fractal-like
pattern in the veins on a leaf,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.150
river networks, the blood
vessels in our lungs,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.350
even lightning,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.790
and in all of these cases,

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.940
we can describe the
pattern with a power law.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.970
Power laws and fractals
are intrinsically linked.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.820
That's because power laws
reveal something fundamental

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.740
about a system's structure.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.140
- So I've got a magnet
and I've got a screw,

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.570
and you'll notice if I
bring them close together,

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.270
then the screw gets
attracted to the magnet,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.740
and that's because
there's a lot of iron it,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.510
which is ferromagnetic.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.010
But watch what happens if
I start heating this up.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.093
Trying to...

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:48.390
Oh!

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.302
You see that?

00:15:49.302 --> 00:15:50.135
Ah, there it went!

00:15:50.135 --> 00:15:50.968
There it went!

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:54.480
You see, you heat it up and
suddenly it becomes nonmagnetic.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.740
To find out what happened,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.050
let's zoom in on this magnet.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.010
- Inside a magnet,

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.230
each atom has its own magnetic moment,

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.310
which means you can think of it

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.650
like its own little magnet or compass.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.630
If one atom's moment points up,

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.670
its neighbors tend to point that way too

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.580
since this lowers the system's
overall potential energy.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.960
Therefore at low temperatures,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.000
you get large regions called domains

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.370
where all the moments align.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.560
And when many of these domains also align,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.870
their individual magnetic fields reinforce

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.930
to create an overall
field around the magnet.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.550
But if you heat up the magnet,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.010
each atom starts vibrating vigorously.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.110
The moments flip up and down

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.750
and so the alignment can break down.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.460
And when all the moments cancel out,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.760
then there's no longer
a net magnetic field.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.230
Now, if you have the right equipment,

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.420
you can balance any magnetic material

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.280
right on that transition point,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.040
right between magnetic and nonmagnetic.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.930
This is called the critical point

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.150
and it occurs at a specific temperature

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.160
called the Curie temperature.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.770
I asked Casper and the
team to build a simulation

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.350
to show what's going on inside the magnet

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.643
at this critical point.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.700
- Each pixel represents
the magnetic moment

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.020
of an individual atom.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.020
Let's say red is up and blue is down.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.670
Now, when the temperature is low,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.230
we get these big domains

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.660
where the magnetic moments are all aligned

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.150
and you get an overall magnetic field.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.760
But if we really crank up the temperature,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.130
then all of these moments
start flipping up and down

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.850
and so they cancel out and the
magnet loses its magnetism,

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.700
so that's exactly what
happened in our demo.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.280
But if we tune the temperature just right,

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.380
right to that Curie temperature,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.650
then the pattern becomes
way more interesting.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.973
- This looks like a map.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.010
- Like a map?

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.950
- Yeah, it almost looks like
the Mediterranean or something.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.350
It's almost stable,

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.900
like atoms that are pointing one way

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.500
tend to point that way for a while,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.520
but there is clearly fluctuations as well,

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.610
so domains are constantly
coming and going.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.000
It's both got some elements of stability

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.070
and some persistence over time,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.410
some features which are consistent,

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.019
but it's also not locked in place

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:12.090
because you notice changes over time.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.960
- [Casper] If you zoom in,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.820
you find that the same kinds of patterns

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.140
repeat at all scales.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.850
You've got domains of tens of atoms,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.220
hundreds, thousands, even millions.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.530
There's just no inherent
scale to the system,

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.450
that is, it's scale-free,

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.100
it's just like a fractal.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.770
And if you plot the size
distribution of the domains,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.633
you get a power law.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.950
- The underlying geometry
suddenly shows a fractal character

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.130
that it doesn't have on either
side of the phase transition.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.570
Right at the phase transition,

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.217
you get fractal behavior

00:18:41.217 --> 00:18:43.440
and that pops out as a power law.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.600
- In fact, whenever you find a power law,

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.550
that indicates you're
dealing with a system

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.950
that has no intrinsic scale,

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.430
and that is a signature of a
system in a critical state,

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.940
which turns out has huge consequences.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.460
- See, normally in a magnet
below the Curie temperature,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.890
each atom influences only its neighbors.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.050
If one atom's magnetic moment flips up,

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.390
then that means that its
neighbors are slightly more likely

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.740
to point up too.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.120
But that influence is local,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.040
it dies out just a few atoms away.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.560
But as the magnet approaches
its critical temperature,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.170
those local influences
start to chain together.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.790
One spin nudges its neighbor

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.400
and that neighbor nudges
the next and so on,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.860
like a rumor spreading through a crowd.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.380
And the result is that the
effective range of influence

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.490
keeps expanding,

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.230
and right at the critical point,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.540
it becomes effectively infinite.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.700
A flip on one side can cascade

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.280
throughout the entire material.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.700
So you get these small
causes, just a single flip,

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.370
to reverberate throughout
the entire system.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.370
- And it gets right into that point

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.820
where the system is maximally unstable,

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.990
anything can happen.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.810
It's also maximally interesting in a way.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.183
It means the system is most unpredictable,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.520
most uncertain,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.500
it's really hard to know
what's gonna happen next,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.720
and that seems to be a natural procedure

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.270
that happens in many different
systems in the world.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.643
- One such system is forest fires.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.370
In June, 1988,

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.200
a lightning strike started a small fire

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.540
near Yellowstone National Park.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.310
This was nothing out of the ordinary.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.590
Each year, Yellowstone
experiences thousands

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.730
of lightning strikes.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.200
Most don't cause fires

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.300
and those that do tend
to burn a few trees,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.485
maybe even a few acres
before they fizzle out.

00:20:24.485 --> 00:20:28.230
3/4 of fires burn less
than 1/4 of an acre.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.300
The largest fire in the
park's recent history

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.190
occurred in 1931.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.440
That burned through 18,000 acres,

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.020
an area slightly larger than Manhattan.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.570
But the 1988 fire was different,

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.450
that initial spark spread slowly at first

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.490
covering several thousand acres.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.260
Then over the next couple of months,

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.850
it merged with other small fires

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.400
to create an enormous complex of megafires

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.840
that blazed across 1.4
million acres of land.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.170
That's around the size of
the entire state of Delaware.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.080
That's 70 times bigger
than the previous record,

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.660
and 50 times the area of all the fires

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.080
over the previous 15 years combined.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.470
So, what was so special
about the 1988 fires?

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.920
Well, to find out, we made
a forest fire simulator.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.380
- We've got a grid of squares,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.760
and on each square,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.160
either a tree could be
there, it could grow,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.240
or it could not be there.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.060
There's gonna be some probability
for lightning strikes.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.040
So the higher that probability,

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.780
the more fires we're gonna have.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.490
We can run this.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.960
- So trees are growing.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.490
- [Casper] Trees are growing,

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.843
- Forest is filling in.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.450
Nice.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.040
Getting pretty dense.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.900
- What do you expect is gonna happen?

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.943
- I expect to see some fires.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.480
Probably, you know, now that...

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.618
Oh!

00:21:46.618 --> 00:21:47.451
That was good,

00:21:47.451 --> 00:21:49.357
that was a good little fire.

00:21:49.357 --> 00:21:50.190
Whoa!

00:21:52.289 --> 00:21:53.703
Whoa!

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.193
No way!

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.220
Well, that's crazy.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.870
You haven't adjusted
the parameters, right?

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.850
It's just like-
- Not yet, not yet.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:07.500
- This seems like a very critical
situation just by itself.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.870
I say that because of
how big that fire was.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.160
- This sort of system will
tune itself to criticality,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.050
and you can see it start to happen.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:16.920
So right now,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.620
I think it's a good moment
where you have basically domains

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.600
of a lot of different sizes.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.340
And then one way to think about it

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.220
is if some of these
domains become too big,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.060
then you get a single fire
like that one, perfectly timed.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.710
- Burns them all out.
- It's just gonna propagate

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.770
throughout the whole thing and
burn it back down a little.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.270
But then if it goes too hard,

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.537
then now you've got all these domains

00:22:37.537 --> 00:22:38.370
where there are no trees

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.290
and so it's gonna grow again

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.360
to bring it back to that critical state.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.390
- I can see how it's the
feedback mechanism, right,

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.790
that the fire gets rid of all the trees

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.470
and there's nothing left to burn,

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.420
and then that has to fill in again.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.740
- [Casper] Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.360
But if there hasn't been a fire,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.980
then the forest gets too thick

00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.270
and then it's ripe for
this sort of massive fire.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.103
- For a magnet,

00:23:01.103 --> 00:23:03.750
you have to painstakingly
tune it to the critical point,

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.720
but the forest naturally
drives itself there.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.080
This phenomenon is called
self-organized criticality.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.370
Yeah, and if you let it run,

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.180
what you get is, again,
a power law distribution.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.890
So this is log-log,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.630
so it should be a straight line.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.050
- That kind of stuff
seems so totally random

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.037
and unpredictable,

00:23:23.037 --> 00:23:25.050
and it is in one way,

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.640
and yet it follows a pattern.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.650
There's a consistent mathematical pattern

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.393
to all these kind of disasters.

00:23:31.445 --> 00:23:33.300
It's shocking.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.210
- Is there something fractal about this?

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.810
- Mostly in terms of the, I
guess, domains of the trees

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.240
when you're at that critical state.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.750
So you get very dense areas,
you get non-dense areas.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.360
And as a result, when a
single lightning bolt strikes,

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.610
you can get fires of all sizes.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.210
Most often you get small fires
of 10 or fewer trees burning.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.500
A little less frequently,

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.660
you get fires of less than 100 trees.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.430
And then every once in a while,

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.200
you get these massive fires

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.140
that reverberate throughout
the entire system.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.810
Now, you might expect that
because the fire is so large,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.660
there has to be a
significant event causing it,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.190
but that's not the case

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.920
because the cause for each
fire is the exact same,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.080
it's a single lightning strike.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.360
The only difference is where it strikes

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.180
and the exact makeup of
the forest at that time.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.310
So in some very real way,

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.930
the large fires are nothing more

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.300
than magnified versions of the small ones,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.610
and even worse, they're inevitable.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.630
So what we've learned

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.700
is that for systems in a critical state,

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.550
there are no special events
causing the massive fires.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:39.000
There was nothing special
about the Yellowstone fire.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.730
- In 1935, the US Forest
Service established

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.040
the so-called 10:00 AM policy.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.140
The plan was to suppress every single fire

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.620
by 10:00 AM on the day
following its initial report.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.170
Now, naively, this strategy makes sense.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.840
I mean, if you keep all
fires under strict control,

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.240
then none can ever get out of hand.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.573
But it turns out this
strategy is extremely risky.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.050
- So let's say we're gonna bring down

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.730
the lightning probability,

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.930
so it's very small,

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.880
only one in a million right now,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.780
and we're also gonna crank up
the tree growth a little bit.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.910
Now what do you think is gonna happen?

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.460
- We're gonna get some big
fires, I would imagine,

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.660
like a lot of not fire
and then some huge fires.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.986
Yeah.

00:25:22.986 --> 00:25:25.110
(Derek laughs)

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.100
- [Casper] Yep.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.240
- Oh boy.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.073
- [Casper] So nowadays,

00:25:28.073 --> 00:25:30.330
the fire service has a
very different approach.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.520
They acknowledge that
some fires are essential

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.830
to make the megafires less likely.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.720
So they let most small fires burn

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.030
and only intervene when necessary.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.180
In some cases, they even
intentionally create small fires

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.220
to burn through some of the buildup,

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.360
though it could take years

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.190
to return the forest to its natural state

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.860
after a century of fire suppression.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.720
But it's more than just
the Earth's forests

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.770
that are balanced in this critical state.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.970
Every day, the Earth's crust is moving

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.290
and rearranging itself.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.730
Stresses build up slowly

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.280
as tectonic plates rub against each other.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.830
Most of the time, you get
a few rocks crumbling,

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.740
the ground might move just
a fraction of a millimeter,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.960
but the stresses dissipate
in many earthquakes

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.790
that you wouldn't even feel.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.260
- There are really tiny earthquakes

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.620
that are happening right
now beneath your feet,

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.350
you just can't feel 'em
because they're very small.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.460
But they are earthquakes,

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.610
they're driven by small slipping movements

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.020
in the Earth's crust.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.180
- [Casper] But sometimes
those random movements

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.540
can trigger a powerful chain reaction.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.560
- [Derek] In Kobe, Japan,

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.340
the morning of January 17, 1995
seemed just like any other.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.690
This was a peaceful city,

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.220
and although Japan as a country

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.720
is no stranger to earthquakes,

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.630
Kobe hadn't suffered a
major quake for centuries.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.650
Generations grew up

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.560
believing the ground
beneath them was stable,

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.390
but that morning, deep underground,

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.960
a stress released nearby
the Nojima fault line.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.630
The stress propagated to the
next section of the fault

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.560
and the next.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.430
Within seconds,

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.460
the ruptured cascaded along
40 kilometers of crust,

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.530
shifting the ground by up to two meters

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.120
and releasing the energy equivalent

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.130
of numerous atomic bombs.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.590
The resulting quake
destroyed thousands of homes

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.030
along with most major roads

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.830
and railways leading into the city.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.780
It killed over 6,000 people

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.513
and forced 300,000 from their homes.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.230
- How far it goes depends a lot on chance

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.260
and the organization of
all that stress field

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.430
in the Earth's crust.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.340
And it just seems to be
organized in such a way

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.680
that it is possible oftentimes

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.350
for the earthquake to
trickle along an avalanche

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.850
along a long way

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.370
and produce a very large
unusual earthquake.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.980
But if you look at the process
behind that earthquake,

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.830
it is exactly the same physical process.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.200
It's just that the
earthquake-generating process

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.000
naturally produces events

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.760
that range over an
enormous range of scale,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.010
and we're not really used
to thinking about that.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.750
- We have this ingrained assumption

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.390
that we can use the past
to predict the future,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.040
but when it comes to earthquakes

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.740
or any system that's in a critical state,

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.870
that assumption can be catastrophic

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.940
because they're famously unpredictable.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.190
So, how can you even
begin to model something

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.440
like the behavior of earthquakes?

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.960
- [Derek] In 1987,
Danish physicist Per Bak

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.930
and his colleagues considered
a simple thought experiment.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.570
Take a grain of sand
and drop it on a grid,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.760
then keep dropping grains on top

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.550
until at some point the
sandpile gets so steep

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.790
that the grains tumble down
onto different squares.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.330
- What they looked at
was the size of these,

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.920
what they were calling avalanches,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.460
these reorganizations of
numbers of grains of sand.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.530
They asked for how often
do you see avalanches

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.090
of a certain size.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.200
- This is the most simple
version of a sandpile simulator

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.250
that you could almost imagine.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.590
We're gonna drop a little grain of sand

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.630
at first always in the center,

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.820
and then it's just gonna keep going up.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.110
For one grain, it'll be fine.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.250
For two grains, it'll be fine.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.810
Three grains, it'll be fine,

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.310
but it's on the edge of toppling.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.470
And then when it reaches four or more,

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.483
it's gonna basically go.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.530
It feels a bit like a, I
don't know, pulsing thing,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.630
like something's trying
to escape or something,

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.340
very video game-like.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.750
That seemed pretty crazy.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.970
And it is symmetrical.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.130
- Yeah, nice geometric features.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.150
- So this might be interesting

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.340
because right now we passed it at a point

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.983
where this middle one is gonna go,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.890
and then you look around it and you see,

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.160
essentially you can think of these brown

00:29:25.253 --> 00:29:28.360
or these three tall grain stacks

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.660
as being maximally unstable.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.920
They're about to go,

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.150
and so you could think of them

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.880
as these fingers of instability.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.770
If anything touches them,

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.149
like, they're just gonna go.

00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:42.900
(lively music)

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.150
- I see it propagating out.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.680
- It's cool seeing it slower.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.430
I feel like you can see several waves

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.650
propagating at the same time.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.660
- Some people have reasoned
that the Earth's crust

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.540
becomes riddled with similar
fingers of instability

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.370
where you get stresses building up,

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.140
and then when one rock crumbles,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.060
it can propagate along these fingers,

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.060
potentially triggering
massive earthquakes.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.230
If you look at the data,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.360
there's some even more compelling evidence

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.290
that links the sandpile
simulation to earthquakes.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.450
- Let's say instead of
dropping it at the center,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.300
pretty unrealistic to have
it drop in the center,

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.003
I'm gonna drop at random.

00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:25.020
- Hah!

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.430
That's crazy.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.230
- You can actually see it tune itself

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.343
to the critical state.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.800
Like at the start,

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.150
you only see these super tiny avalanches

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.450
and then now it's everything.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.190
- It has to build up.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.590
- We can slow down a little.

00:30:42.247 --> 00:30:44.283
Oh, and that's a super clean power law.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.520
There are events of all sizes.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.220
One grain of sand might
knock over just a few others

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.490
or it could trigger an
avalanche of millions of grains

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.340
that cascade throughout the entire system.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.260
And if you look at the power law

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.090
you get from the sandpile simulation,

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.310
it closely resembles the power law

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.880
of the energy released
by real earthquakes.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.310
But if you look at the sandpile
experiment more closely,

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.920
it doesn't just resemble earthquakes.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.420
What does it remind you of?

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.515
- Forest fires.
- [Casper] Right?

00:31:14.515 --> 00:31:16.920
It feels like it's the
exact same behavior.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.720
- That's the really surprising thing,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.850
and that's why this little
paper with a sandpile

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.280
was published in the world's top journal

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.300
because it did something

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.660
that people just didn't
really think was possible.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.230
- Now, what's ironic is if
you look at real sandpiles,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.870
they don't behave like this.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.070
- Okay, you said sand,

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.380
I'm gonna do an experiment
on a real sandpile.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.870
And of course, it doesn't
follow a power law distribution

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.640
of avalanches at all.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.293
It's totally wrong.

00:31:43.293 --> 00:31:44.670
(Steven and Derek laugh)

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:49.140
Per Bak, naturally, gets a
chance to reply to the criticism,

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.560
and he says, I'm pretty close to quoting,

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.420
he says, "Self-organized criticality

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.433
only applies to the
systems it applies to."

00:31:57.433 --> 00:31:58.770
(Steven laughs)

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.090
So he doesn't care,

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.480
the fact that his theory is
not relevant to real sandpiles.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.410
So what?

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.610
Get out of my face.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:10.350
He's interested in bigger
fish to fry than sandpiles.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.300
It's like, you're taking me too literally.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.250
I'm talking about a universal mechanism

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.990
for generating power laws.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.960
And the fact that it
doesn't work in real sand

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.520
is uninteresting to him.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.800
I thought that took some real nerve.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.280
- You could think about the Earth

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.260
and the Earth going around the Sun.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.333
That's a very complex system.

00:32:31.258 --> 00:32:32.160
You've got the molten core,

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.240
everything sloshing around,

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.560
and you've got oceans,

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.510
and you've even got the
moon going around the Earth,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.100
which in theory, you know,

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.020
all should affect the exact motion

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.210
of the Earth around the Sun.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.100
But Newton ignored all of that,

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.450
all he looked at was just a
single parameter, essentially,

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.100
the mass of the Earth.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.290
And with that, he could
correctly, for the most part,

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.510
predict how the Earth was
gonna go around the Sun.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.130
Similarly here,

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.440
there are people that have
looked at these phenomena

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.000
that go to the critical state,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.120
in this case it's
self-organized criticality,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.070
is it brings itself there,

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.890
and what they find is that
there's this universal behavior

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:11.370
where it doesn't even really
matter what the subparts are,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.760
you just get the behavior
that's the exact same.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.410
- At that critical point

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.750
when all the forces are poised

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.240
and the system is right
on that delicate balance

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.360
between being organized, highly organized,

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.160
or being totally disorganized,

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.820
it turns out that almost
none of the physical details

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.810
about that system matter
to how it behaves.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.290
There's just a universal
behavior that is irrespective

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.840
of what physical system
you're talking about.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.810
The term that was used
is called universality,

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.100
and it's kind of a miracle,

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.340
it means you can make
extremely powerful theories

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.470
without involving any technical details,

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.080
any real details of the material.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.150
- What this means is that
you could have these systems

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:57.240
that on the surface
seem totally different,

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.890
but when you get to the critical point,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.590
they all behave in the exact same way.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.400
The other thing you could do
is instead of this being trees,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.230
you could imagine it being people

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.880
and the thing that's spreading-

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.900
- Is disease.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.390
- Is disease, yeah.

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:15.030
- You almost get something for nothing

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.560
at these critical points.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.840
- See, many of these systems
fall into what's known

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.490
as universality classes.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.560
Some of them you need
to tune to get there,

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.420
like magnets at their Curie temperature

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.180
or fluids like water or carbon dioxide

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.440
at their critical point,

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.790
but some other systems

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.220
seem to organize
themselves to criticality,

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.000
like the forest fires or
sandpiles or earthquakes.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.280
But what's crazy is that if you succeed

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.100
in understanding just
one system from a class,

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.670
then you know how all the
systems in that class behave,

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.210
and that includes even the
crudest simplest toy models,

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.220
like the simulations we've looked at.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.310
So you can model
incredibly complex systems

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.320
with the most basic of models.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.540
And some people think
this critical thinking

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.160
applies even further.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.570
When we look around the world,

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:01.950
there are lots of systems

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.750
that show the same power law behavior

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.760
that we see in this critical systems.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.040
It's in everything from DNA sequencing

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.950
to the distribution of
species in an ecosystem

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.920
to the size of mass
extinctions throughout history.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.560
We even see the same
behavior in human systems,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.270
like the populations of cities,

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.220
fluctuations in stock prices,

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.260
citations of scientific papers,

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.340
and even the number of deaths in wars.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.900
So some people argue that these systems

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.440
and perhaps many parts of our
world also organize themselves

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.000
to this critical point.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.370
- So the fact that all
these natural hazards,

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.203
as they call them,

00:35:36.203 --> 00:35:38.220
floods, wildfires, and earthquakes,

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.440
they all follow power law distributions

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.060
means that these extreme
events are much more common

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.180
than you would think based on
normal distribution thinking.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.160
- If you find yourself in a situation

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.270
or an environment that is sort
of governed by a power law,

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.670
how should you change your behavior?

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:01.050
- If you have events with one
of these power distributions,

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.350
what you're seeing most of
the time is small events.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:08.250
And this can lull you into
a false sense of security,

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.260
you think you understand
how things are going.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.880
You know, floods for example,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.870
there are a lot of small floods,

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.120
and then every once in a
while, there's a huge one.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.403
One response to this is insurance,

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.510
that insurance is designed precisely

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.300
to protect you against
the large rare events

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.770
that would otherwise be very bad.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.310
But then there's the other
side of that picture,

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.620
which is you are the insurance company

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.540
that needs to insure people

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.520
and they have a particularly difficult job

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.750
because they have to be able
to say how much to charge

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.580
so that they have enough money to pay out

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.070
when the big bad thing comes along.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:44.903
- [Derek] In 2018,

00:36:44.903 --> 00:36:47.460
a forest fire tore through
Paradise, California,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.570
it became the deadliest

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.330
and most destructive fire
in the state's history,

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.360
but the insurance company,
Merced Property &amp; Casualty,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.240
hadn't planned for something that huge,

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.770
and when the claims came in,

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.650
they just didn't have
the reserves to pay out.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.920
So just like that, the company went bust.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.890
- But while extreme events
can cripple some companies,

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.870
there are entire industries

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.600
that are built on power law distributions.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.630
Between 1985 and 2014,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.580
private equity firm Horsley Bridge

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.220
invested in 7,000 different startups

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.070
and over half of their
investments actually lost money,

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.400
but the top 6% more than 10xed in value

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.790
and generated 60% of the
firm's overall profit.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.740
In fact, the best venture capital firms

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.200
often have more investments
that lose money,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.540
they just have a few crazy outliers

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.430
that show extraordinary growth,

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.640
a few outliers that carry
the entire performance.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.380
In 2012, Y Combinator calculated
that 75% of their returns

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:50.460
came from just two out of the
280 startups they invested in.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.880
So venture capital is a world
that depends on taking risks

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.150
in the hope that you'll get a
few of these extreme outliers

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.890
which outperform all of the rest

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.900
of the investments combined.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.540
- [Derek] Book publishers
operate in a similar fashion,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.040
most titles flop,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.390
but in 1997,

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.270
a small independent UK
publisher called Bloomsbury

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.030
took a chance on a story
about a boy wizard.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.340
The boy's name, of
course, was Harry Potter,

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.283
and now Bloomsbury is a
globally recognized brand.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.210
We see a similar pattern play
out on streaming platforms.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.810
On Netflix, the top 6% of
shows account for over half

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.790
of all viewing hours on the platform.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.660
On YouTube,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.870
less than 4% of videos
ever reach 10,000 views,

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:35.220
but those videos account
for over 93% of all views.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.200
- All these domains
follow the same principle

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.930
that Pareto identified over 100 years ago

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.410
where the majority of the
wealth goes to the richest few.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:47.310
The entire game is defined
by the rare runaway hits.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.430
- But not every industry
can play this game.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.750
Like if you're running a restaurant,

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.000
you need to fill tables night after night.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.250
You can't have one particularly
busy summer evening

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.870
that brings in millions of customers

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.000
to make up for a bunch of quiet nights.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.820
Over a year, the busy nights
and quiet ones balance out

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.650
and you're left with the average.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.820
Airlines are similar,

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.280
an airline needs to fill
seats on each flight.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.220
You can't squeeze a million
passengers onto one plane,

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.620
so it's the average number
of passengers over the year

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.170
that defines an airline's success.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:17.490
- We're used to living in this world

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.310
of normal distributions
and you act a certain way,

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.770
but as soon as you switch to this realm

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.090
that is governed by a power law,

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.610
you need to start acting vastly different.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.980
It really pays to know what kind of world

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.720
or what kind of game you're playing.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.553
- That is good.

00:39:31.553 --> 00:39:32.760
That's good, yes.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.813
You should come on camera and
just say that just like that.

00:39:35.813 --> 00:39:37.905
You were on camera, you just did do it.

00:39:37.905 --> 00:39:40.064
(Steven laughs)
- If you are in a world

00:39:40.064 --> 00:39:42.960
where random additive
variations cancel out over time,

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.910
then you get a normal distribution.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:47.370
And in this case, it's
the average performance,

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.010
so consistency, which is important.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.860
But if you are in a world
that's governed by a power law

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.540
where your returns can multiply

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.240
and they can grow over
many orders of magnitude,

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.820
then it might make sense
to take some riskier bets

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.220
in the hope that one
of them pays off huge.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.053
In other words,

00:40:03.053 --> 00:40:07.020
it becomes more important to
be persistent than consistent.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.820
- [Derek] Though as we saw
in the second coin game,

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.800
totally random multiplicative returns

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.280
give you a log normal
distribution, not a power law.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.150
To get a power law,

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.673
there must be some
other mechanism at play.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.950
In the early 2000s,

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.650
Albert-László Barabási
was studying the internet,

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.610
and to his surprise,

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:26.130
he found that there was no normal webpage

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.170
with some average number of links.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.720
Instead, the distribution
followed a power law.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.190
A few sites like Yahoo

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.410
had thousands of times more connections

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.030
than most of the others.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.250
Barabasi wondered what could be causing

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.900
this power law of the internet,

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.610
so he made a simple prediction.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.860
As new sites were added to the internet,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.890
they were more likely to
link to well-known pages.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:48.060
To test this prediction,

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.570
he and his colleague Réka Albert 
ran a simulation.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.910
They started with a
network of just a few nodes

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.550
and gradually they added
new nodes to the network

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.130
with each new node more
likely to connect to those

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.450
with the most links.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:03.420
As the network grew, a power law emerged.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.190
The power was around negative two,

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.910
which almost exactly matched
the real data of the internet.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.040
- [Casper] Look at that.
- [Derek] That's fun.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.420
- It's still so satisfying.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.510
This will basically also
distribute a power law.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.510
One of the ideas here is that
this could be individuals

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.560
or even companies,

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.150
and so if you're more likely

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.950
to become more successful
or more well known

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.910
or successful you already are,

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.620
you're gonna get this
sort of runaway effect

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.553
where you get a few that sort
of dominate the distributions.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.920
I wonder if part of the takeaway

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.350
is like if you're
playing some sort of game

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.300
that is dominated by a power law,

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.550
then you better do the work as much of it

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.720
as early as possible

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.320
so you get to benefit from the
snowball effect, essentially.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.660
- Yeah, I guess that's a good idea.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.880
I'm not sure whether you
can control it, though.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.680
Human beings like to think of ourselves

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.390
as being a bit special,

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.820
and that maybe somehow
because we're intelligent

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.653
and have free will.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:04.730
We will escape the provenance
of the laws of physics

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.930
in order and organization,

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.120
but I think that's probably not the case.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.450
So if you look at the
number of world wars,

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:15.870
and if you make a crude measure
of how big is the world war

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.600
by how many people it kills,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.060
which is a bit macabre, but still,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.640
you find that, again,
it follows a power law

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.710
virtually identical to
the power law you find

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.630
in stock market crashes.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.420
- So if the world is shaped by power laws,

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.070
then it feels like we're poised

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:33.840
in this kind of critical state

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.060
where two identical grains of sand,

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.020
two identical actions can
have wildly different effects.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.030
Most things barely move the needle,

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.850
but a few rare events
totally dwarf the rest,

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.760
and that, I think, is the
most important lesson.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.530
If you choose to pursue areas

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.300
governed by the normal distribution,

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.150
you can pretty much
guarantee average results.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.670
But if you select pursuits
ruled by power laws,

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.410
the goal isn't to avoid risk,

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.900
it's to make repeated intelligent bets.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.280
Most of them will fail,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.090
but you only need one wild
success to pay for all the rest.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.880
- And the thing is that
beforehand you cannot know

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.080
which bet is going to be

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.630
because the system is
maximally unpredictable.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.520
It could be that your
next bet does nothing,

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.660
it could do a little bit,

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.090
or it could change your entire life.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:19.860
In fact, around three years ago,

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.570
I was reading this little book,

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.370
and in the book there was this little line

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.427
saying something like,

00:43:24.427 --> 00:43:27.960
"One idea could transform
your entire life."

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.977
So right underneath that, I wrote,

00:43:29.977 --> 00:43:32.130
"Send an email to Veritasium."

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.417
A couple days later, I wrote
an email to Derek, saying,

00:43:34.417 --> 00:43:36.510
"Hey, Derek, I'm Casper.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.330
I study physics and I can
help you research videos."

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:41.130
I didn't hear back for four weeks,

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.600
so I was getting pretty sad

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.290
and just wanted to forget
about it and move on,

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:49.297
but then a couple days later
I got an email back saying,

00:43:49.297 --> 00:43:52.410
"Hey, Casper, we can't do
an internship right now,

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.810
but how would you like to research, write,

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.180
and produce a video as a freelancer?"

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.200
So I did,

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.693
and that's how I get
started at Veritasium.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.720
Hey, just a few quick final things.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.090
All the simulations that
we used in this video

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:11.730
we'll make available
for free for you to use

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.100
in the link in the description.

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.440
And the other thing is
that we just launched

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.420
the official Veritasium game.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.740
It's called Elements of Truth

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.830
and it's a tabletop game
with over 800 questions.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.950
It's the perfect way to
challenge your friends

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:27.300
and see who comes out on top.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.180
Now, at Veritasium, we're
all quite competitive,

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.940
so every time we play, things
get a little bit heated,

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.880
but that's honestly a big part of the fun.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.710
Now, when we launched on Kickstarter,

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.690
we got a lot of questions asking

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.150
if we could ship to specific countries.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.550
And originally we didn't enable this,

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:45.960
and this is our mistake,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.450
this is on us and we totally hear you,

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.410
but I'm glad to say

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:52.320
that right now we have
enabled worldwide shipping.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.000
So no matter where you are in the world,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.950
you can get your very own copy.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.680
To reserve your copy and get involved,

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.100

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.930
I wanna thank you for all your support,

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.243
and most of all, thank you for watching.
