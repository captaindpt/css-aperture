# Video Analysis: The Book that Killed the American Dream

## Overview
This comprehensive video essay examines how F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" (1925) systematically dismantled the American Dream through its portrayal of characters, setting, and themes. The analysis argues that Fitzgerald not only critiqued the America of his time but prophetically predicted the corruption of American ideals through materialism and class stratification.

## Key Findings

### Theme 1: The American Dream as Propaganda
Fitzgerald presents the American Dream as a "former truth long distorted by the realities of American society":

**Historical Context:**
- The term "American Dream" wasn't coined until the 1930s, 7 years after Gatsby was written
- The myth existed for centuries as the belief that "even those born at the bottom may rise up to the Pinnacle of society"
- Traditional components: owning a house, impacting the nation, moving mountains through "tenacity, talent, optimism, grit"
- For Fitzgerald, this had "decayed into a propaganda"

**Influence of Oswald Spengler:**
- Fitzgerald read "The Decline of the West" while writing Gatsby: "I don't think I ever quite recovered from him"
- Spengler's concept of "thinking in money" rather than "thinking in goods" became central to Gatsby
- Western civilization portrayed as decomposing through urbanization and materialism

### Theme 2: Jay Gatsby as the Corrupted American Dreamer
Gatsby embodies both the aspiration and corruption of the American Dream:

**Gatsby's True Nature:**
- Born James Gatz, rejected his "shiftless and unsuccessful farm people" parents
- "His imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all"
- The American dreamer is "propelled by the dreamer's disavowal of his or her past"
- Greatest American dreamers "say yes but their power comes first from saying no"

**Criminal Foundation:**
- Achieves wealth through bootlegging, not "schooling and career building"
- Fitzgerald rejects traditional social mobility claimed by the American Dream
- Even intelligent, capable people resort to "illegitimate gains and criminality"

**Material Substitution for Identity:**
- Gatsby's wealth "often takes the place of Gatsby himself"
- Defined by his "colossal affair" mansion modeled after European hotels
- Throws parties that are "celebrations of money itself"
- Uses servants as mere "tools for Gatsby's glamorous lifestyle"

> "Gatsby who we take as the embodiment of the American dream is built on the backs of the poor his life requires exploitation like his machine extracts the juice from oranges only to discard the quote pulpless halves"

### Theme 3: Daisy as Symbol, Not Person
Daisy represents the American Dream itself - an idealized goal that reveals its true nature upon close examination:

**Gatsby's Attraction to Status, Not Love:**
- First attracted to Daisy's house, not Daisy herself: "it amazed him he had never been in such a beautiful house before"
- The house had "breathless intensity," described as "beautiful" - not Daisy
- Daisy's previous lovers "increased her value in his eyes" - market terms applied to person
- "took what he could get ravenously and unscrupulously"

**The Illusion of Romance:**
- Gatsby's love "was not for Daisy it was for Daisy's world for what she represented"
- When he finally achieves proximity to Daisy, "the Colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever"
- His "count of Enchanted objects had diminished by one"

**Daisy's Own Corruption:**
- "Paralyzed with happiness" - victim of American materialism
- Understands the system: hopes her daughter "will be a fool that's the best thing a girl can be in this world"
- Ultimately prioritizes status over love, abandoning Gatsby for security with Tom

### Theme 4: The Buchanan Elite - Careless Destruction
Tom and Daisy represent the established elite who maintain power through destruction:

**Tom as Proto-Fascist:**
- "Brutish," "cruel body," "capable of enormous leverage"  
- "Spews racist vitriol detests the lower class"
- Represents "generations of wealthy American families who conquered the lower classes"
- Destroys Gatsby's lifelong work with "brief monologue"

**Elite Carelessness:**
- "They were careless people Tom and Daisy they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money"
- "Let other people clean up the mess they had made"
- Tom has "no career and contributing nothing to society" yet "enormously wealthy"
- After engineering chaos, they "simply believe they just move on Unbound by consequence"

### Theme 5: Geographic Symbolism - East Egg vs. West Egg vs. Valley of Ashes
The setting creates a powerful allegory for class structure:

**West Egg (New Money):**
- Where Gatsby lives
- Houses "aspirationally modeled after famous mansions in Europe"  
- Represents the dreamers and social climbers

**East Egg (Old Money):**
- Where the Buchanans live
- "More desirable fashionable part of town"
- Represents those who "already sit at the top"

**Valley of Ashes (The Poor):**
- "Bleak industrial Wasteland between the two eggs"
- Inhabited by "the very poor" including Myrtle and George
- Described with "Ash Gray paintless days spasms of Bleak dust"
- "A solemn Dumping Ground" - the only setting not "aesthetically magnificent"

**The Hidden Foundation:**
- The Valley represents where "the opulence of the buchanans and the gatses is truly produced"
- "The dirty secret the hidden ingredient of our American dream"
- Most tragic events occur here: Tom's abuse, Myrtle's death, which leads to Gatsby's murder

### Theme 6: Dr. T.J. Eckleburg's Eyes - Divine Judgment
The famous billboard serves as moral commentary:

**Religious Symbolism:**
- "Large pair of blue eyes rimmed by Golden spectacles"
- "Generally accepted that these eyes represent God himself"
- Character explicitly states: "God knows what you've been doing...you may fool me but you can't fool God"
- Fitzgerald appeals "to the highest order even if we the people fail ourselves...we cannot go without punishment God is always watching"

### Theme 7: Fitzgerald's Personal Experience and Prophecy
The author's biography illuminates his critique:

**Fitzgerald's Class Journey:**
- "Decidedly middle class" childhood, father was "twice failed businessman"
- Attended Princeton but dropped out, joined military
- Achieved sudden fame with "This Side of Paradise" (1920)
- "I who knew less of New York than any reporter of 6 months standing was pushed into the position of spokesman for the time"
- Later fell into debt, wrote "trash" stories to climb back to middle class

**The 1929 Validation:**
- Fitzgerald's predictions proved accurate almost immediately
- President Hoover's 1928 proclamation that "the poor man is Vanishing from us" was darkly prophetic
- By 1929: top 1% owned 19% of wealth, top 5% owned 34%
- 50% of families couldn't reach $2,000 minimum threshold for basic necessities
- Stock market crash decimated the dream: personal income dropped 50% within 3 years

**Fitzgerald's Eulogy for the Jazz Age (1931):**
- "It ended 2 years ago because the utter confidence which was its essential prop received an enormous jolt"
- "It was borrowed time anyhow the whole upper tenth of a Nation living with the indifference of grand dukes"

### Theme 8: James Truslow Adams and the True American Dream
The man who coined "American Dream" shared Fitzgerald's concerns:

**Adams' Original Vision (1931):**
- The American Dream "has not been a dream of merely material plenty though that has doubtless counted heavily"
- "It has been a dream of being able to grow to fullest development as man and woman unhampered by the barriers"
- Warning against materialism: American Dream should not be "predicated on larger houses or faster cars"

**The Prescription:**
- "We should not be gatsi and we should not aspire to be the buchanans"
- Must create "a fuller dream than these shimmering objects"
- "Must seek one which elevates and works for all Not Alone the privileged"
- Requires "more than the free hand of our markets it requires caution thought and indeed action"

## Conclusions

"The Great Gatsby" emerges not just as a critique of the 1920s but as a prophetic warning about American society's trajectory. Fitzgerald's genius lay in recognizing that the American Dream had already been corrupted by materialism, substituting authentic human development for mere acquisition of wealth and status.

The novel's enduring relevance stems from its identification of systemic problems that persist today: the substitution of material goods for personal identity, the corruption of merit-based advancement by inherited privilege, and the exploitation of the working class to maintain elite lifestyle.

Fitzgerald's personal experience with both poverty and sudden wealth gave him unique insight into the hollowness of material success. His prediction of economic collapse proved accurate within four years, validating his critique of an unsustainable system built on speculation and inequality.

Most significantly, the analysis reveals that the corruption of the American Dream wasn't accidental but structural. The geographic symbolism of East Egg, West Egg, and the Valley of Ashes shows how the dream depends on maintaining a underclass whose exploitation funds elite excess.

The video's title "The Book that Killed the American Dream" is therefore both literal and metaphorical. Literally, Gatsby exposed the dream as already dead by the 1920s. Metaphorically, by revealing the dream's corruption so clearly, Fitzgerald made it impossible to maintain innocent belief in its promises.

The solution, following James Truslow Adams' original vision, requires moving beyond material definitions of success toward "fuller development as man and woman" - a dream that "elevates and works for all, not alone the privileged." This requires not just market forces but "caution, thought, and indeed action" to create genuine opportunity rather than merely the illusion of mobility.

"The Great Gatsby" thus serves as both diagnosis and warning: American society must choose between authentic human flourishing and the "shimmering objects" that have become substitutes for genuine achievement and happiness.
